gforge-plugin-ldapextauth
-------------------------

This is the external LDAP authentication plugin for Gforge.

Prerequisite:

- install Perl, DBI and DBD::Pg as per Gforge's INSTALL file

Installation:

- files from etc/ go to /etc/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth
- files from bin/ go to /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth/bin
- files from include/ go to /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth/include

Setup:

- customise files in /etc/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth to match your
LDAP installation (server, base DN, and mapping)
- /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth/bin/db-upgrade.pl
- /usr/lib/gforge/bin/register-plugin ldapextauth "LDAP external authentication"

Voil√†, you can now log into Gforge with your existing loginname and
password.  Your account will be created the first time you log in
(which means you can't add someone to a group before his/her first
login).
