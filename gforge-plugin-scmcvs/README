gforge-plugin-scmcvs
--------------------

This is the CVS plugin for Gforge.  It creates CVS repositories and
provides some functionality to manage them.

Prerequisites:

You'll need the DBI and DBD::Pg Perl modules.  On Red Hat systems, you
can get them by installing the libdbi and libdbd-pgsql packages.  On
Debian systems, the packages are called libdbi-perl and libdbd-pg-perl
(but you shouldn't have to worry about them, they'll be installed
automatically).

Installation:

- files from etc/ go to /etc/gforge/plugins/scmcvs, apart from
etc/httpd.conf that you should install as /etc/gforge/httpd.d/10scmcvs
- files from bin/ go to /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmcvs/bin
- files from include/ go to /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmcvs/include
- files from lib/ go to  /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmcvs/lib

Setup:

- customise files in /etc/gforge/plugins/scmcvs to match your
preferences (CVS server, and whether to enable CVS by default for new
projects)
- setup the crontab from debian/cron.d
- gforge-config
- /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmcvs/bin/db-upgrade.pl
- /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmcvs/bin/install-cvs.sh configure
- /usr/lib/gforge/bin/register-plugin scmcvs "CVS"
