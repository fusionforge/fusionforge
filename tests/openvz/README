This is a file to explain how to setup your own openvz virtual hosts

At the moment the setup is using dhcp,
this should not be too difficult to make it work with static network config
but this requires you set IP adresses according with your network config.
The dhcp setup should work on any dhcp capable network.

So, first you need to have a working dhcp server, which I'll suppose you already have.
second you need to setup a bridge, for this you should edit /etc/network/interfaces file
see the exemple in interfaces.sample
The exemple is using static ip, but you can also make this work if you server is using dclient
to get adresses.

This would look like:
---------------------------------
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
#allow-hotplug eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp
auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet dhcp
	bridge_ports eth0
	bridge_fd 9
	bridge_hello 2
	bridge_maxage 12
	bridge_stp off
---------------------------------

Your server must also be openvz capable, you can do so with

> apt-get install vzctl

and an openvz kernel you can get for exemple on an amd64 server with

> apt-get install linux-image-2.6-openvz-amd64

A list of available kernel can be found with

> apt-cache search linux-image openvz

Then you have to reboot and you should be ready to build you Virtual servers

> make net 
will setup a /etc/vz/vznet.conf to register new virtual host to vmbr0 bridge (for dhcp setup)

then you can build template
 make builddebiantemplate : build an openvz debian template
 make buildcentostemplate : build an openvz centos template

and create vm
 make createdeb : build a debian openvz vm with ID=105 from the debian template
 make createcentos : build a centos openvz vm with ID=110 from the centos template

choose kind of network
 make netdhcpdeb
 make netstaticdeb
 make netdhcpcentos
 make netstaticcentos
