gforge-plugin-ldapextauth for Debian
------------------------------------

This plugin allows Gforge to authenticate users against an external
LDAP directory.  In order to get it to be useful, you'll have to edit
two configuration files:

- /etc/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth/config.php holds the information
needed to access the LDAP server against which to authenticate, as
well as how to generate the DN to try;

- /etc/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth/mapping.php contains a function
mapping LDAP attributes into the database attributes; compulsory
fields are firstname, lastname and email, but others exist.
