Unofficial packaging of selenium for Debian
-------------------------------------------

The package is very basic and just contains a copy of the upstream jar.

To regenerate the .orig tarball, use 'debian/rules get-orig-source' to
download the upstream standalone distribution (see debian/rules for
more details).
