INSTALLATION of cvssyncmail Plugin

If the directory where the plugins are is /opt/gforge/gforge/plugins you should end up 
	with /opt/gforge/gforge/plugins/cvssyncmail and all the files in it

Be sure that your /etc/gforge/local.inc has a sys_plugins_path set to that location.

The 'Site Admin' tab now has a 'Plugin Manager' link, which can be used to activate /
deactivate plugins. Be sure to activate them if you want them to be available to 
projects.

Each individual project will have to go to the 'Project Admin' -> 'Edit Public Info'
page and choose to use the plugin.
