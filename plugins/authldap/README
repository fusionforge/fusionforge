fusionforge-plugin-authldap
------------------------------

This is the external LDAP authentication plugin for FusionForge.

Installation:

- files from include/ go to /usr/share/gforge/plugins/authldap/include/
- files from www/ go to /usr/share/gforge/www/plugins/authldap/

Setup:

- customise /etc/fusionforge/config.ini.d/authldap.ini to match your
LDAP installation (server, base DN, and mapping)
- /usr/share/gforge/bin/register-plugin authldap "LDAP external
authentication"

Voil√†, you can now log into FusionForge with your existing loginname
and password.  Your account will be created the first time you log in
(which means you can't add someone to a group before his/her first
login).
