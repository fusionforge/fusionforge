README File for gforge-plugin-scmcvs/bin


Syncmail provided version is ready for cvs 1.12.9.
It has to be installed this way in loginfo

ALL $PATH/TO/syncmail -u %p %{sSv} $EMAIL

New syncmail has a restriction in the number of EMAILS. 
This version is restricted to one EMAIL each line in loginfo.

So, you may want to have several lines in loginfo.

UPDATE:
I have added several files called syncmail-cvs-* for
supporting different CVS versions.

The 1.11 version is not very well identified, so maybe
could be 1.12 using -u %1{sSv} options.
