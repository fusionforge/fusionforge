CompactPreview plugin

Provides OSLC-compatible compact preview of recources such as users and projects.

Whenever activated, a JavaScript popup will appear when mouse moves over links 
to user or project profiles, containing a minimal identity card for these.

The code originally existed in the oslc plugin, but was committed in a separate 
plugin so as not to force users to activate the REST web services for the 
trackers if they don't want to.

This plugin was initially developped as part of the COCLICO project with financial 
support from Region Ile de France.

TODO : implement some more preview of the forge's artifacts.
