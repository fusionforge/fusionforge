//"Wiki wiki"// means "quick" in Hawai'ian.

**All you really need to know is:**
* To edit any page click on the //Edit//. You should do that right now, and read the source code of this page. It will make more sense.
* You get italics by surrounding words with two slashes on either side //like this//.
* You get **bold text** by using two asterisks on either side.
* And, **//bold italics//** by using both.
* You get ##monospaced text## by using two hash signs on either side.
* You get bullets by using an asterisk * at the start of the line.
* To have a paragraph in plain monospaced font, start it with ~{~{~{ and end it with ~}~}~}:
{{{
  this is a poem for sure
  about monospacing
  i wrote in purple velour
  but couldn't find a rhyme for monospacing
}}}
* You separate paragraphs with an extra blank line. Example:

  I am a paragraph.

  I am a paragraph too. We're just very small paragraphs.

* You can get horizontal rules with four or more dashes like this:

---------

* To create hyperlinks you just capitalize the words and string them
  together. Let's say you want to create a page about how Steve
  Wainstead eats worms. All you have to do is capitalize each word and
  string them together like this: SteveWainsteadEatsLiveWorms. If the
  page does not exist yet a question mark appears after the link,
  inviting you to create the page: ThisPageShouldNotExist. (And please
  don't ruin the example by creating one.)
* To link to pages outside the Wiki, you can just type in the URL and
  Wiki will link it for you: http://www.nytimes.com/
* To put images in, just provide the hyperlink in brackets like this:
  ~[~http://www.yourhost.yourdomain/images/picture.png]. Image URLs not
  in brackets will just appear as hyperlinks to the image.
* Now you are ready to begin [[Help:AddingPages|adding pages]].

A [[Help:WikiWikiWeb|WikiWikiWeb]] is meant to be fast and easy to edit. It has very simple
markup that you can read about in [[Help:TextFormattingRules]].

If you don't like the size of the text editing window you get, you can
change it. See [[UserPreferences]].
