The **~PhpWeather** [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] is a plugin that uses ~PhpWeather to display
a block of text with the current weather for some airport in the
world. It looks like this:

<<PhpWeather menu=true>>

== Arguments ==

{| class="bordered"
|-
! Argument
! Description
! Default value
|-
| **menu**
|
Set this to ##true## to have the plugin generate a menu after the
report. The user will able to select a country from this menu, and
after that, an airport and a language.
| false
|-
| **icao**
|
Use this to pre-select a specific airport instead of using the
default one which is ##EKAH##.

If you want the user to be able
to change the station using the menu, then you have to use this
as ##<~<PhpWeather menu=true icao|~|~=EKYT>>##
so that the value can be overwritten when the user submits the form.

If you just use ##<~<PhpWeather menu=true icao=EKYT>>##
then nothing will happen when the user selects another station from
the list.
|
|-
| **cc**
|
Specify the country code. You can use this if you want pre-select a
different country than the one specified in the ICAO.

So using ##<~<PhpWeather menu=true cc|~|~=GB icao|~|~=KTTS>>##
will show the current weather at the NASA Shuttle Facility, United
States (##KTTS##) and at the same time give the user a list of
stations in the United Kingdom.

As the example shows, then you
should use ##cc|~|~=XX## when combining it with **menu** set to ##true##.
|-
| **language**
|
The default language. When combining **language** with **menu** set
to ##true## then remember to use the ##language|~|~=xx## form.
|
|-
| **units**
|
You can specify the way the units are printed. The choice is between
having both metric and imperial units printed, or just one of
them. Setting **units** to ##both_metric## will print the metric value
first and then the imperial value in parenthesis. Using ##both_imperial##
instead will do the opposite.

If you only need the metric or imperial units to be shown, then
setting **units** to ##only_metric## or ##only_imperial## will do just that.
