These are here mostly for debugging purposes (at least, that is the hope.)

In normal use, you should not need to use these, though, then again,
they should not really do any harm.

== Purge Markup Cache ==

(If your wiki is so configured,) the transformed (almost-HTML) content
of the most recent version of each page is cached. This speeds up page
rendering since parsing of the wiki-text takes a fair amount of juice.

Hitting this button will delete all cached transformed
content. (Each pages content will be transformed and re-cached next
time someone views it.)

<<WikiAdminUtils action=purge-cache label="Purge Markup Cache" >>

== Clean Wiki Database of Illegal Filenames ==

Page names beginning with the subpage-separator, usually a slash
(##/##), are not allowed. Sometimes though an errant plugin or something
might create one....

This button will delete any pages with illegal page names, without possibility to restore.

<<WikiAdminUtils action=purge-bad-pagenames label="Purge bad pagenames" >>

== Clean Wiki Database of empty and unreferenced pages ==

**Warning!** This button will delete every empty and unreferenced page, without any possibility to restore them again.
This will disable the possibility to revert or get back any deleted page.

<<WikiAdminUtils action=purge-empty-pages label="Purge all empty unreferenced pages" >>

== Convert cached_html to new SQL column ==

This is only needed on SQL or ADODB if you didn't do action=upgrade, but created the
new page.cached_html field seperately, and now you want to move this data from
page.pagedata over to page.cached_html.

<<WikiAdminUtils action=convert-cached-html label="Convert cached_html" >>

== Check Wiki Database ==

This button will check the Wiki page database for consistency. This can last several minutes.

<<WikiAdminUtils action=db-check label="Check Wiki Database" >>

== Rebuild Wiki Database ==

This will retransform all pages and rebuild the Wiki database on consistency errors or parser updates.
This can last several minutes, eat a lot of memory and possibly times out!!

<<WikiAdminUtils action=db-rebuild label="Rebuild Wiki Database" >>
