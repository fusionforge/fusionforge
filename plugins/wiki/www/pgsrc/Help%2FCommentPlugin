The **Comment** [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] lets you hide parts of a Wiki page without actually deleting the text. Comments will only be visible in the Wiki markup when editing or viewing the source.

== Usage ==

Simply place the text to be commented out between {{{<<Comment}}} and {{{>>}}}:

{{{
<<Comment

== A Hidden Section ==

This text will not show up in the generated HTML page, but it is still
visible when editing the WikiMarkup.

>>
}}}

== Author ==
* [[mailto:gimpster@gimpster.com|Martin Geisler]]

<<Comment

== "Fuzzy" Logic ==
Theorem: a cat has nine tails.
Proof:
    No cat has eight tails. A cat has one tail more than no cat.
    Therefore, a cat has nine tails.
