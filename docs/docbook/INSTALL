XML Docbook
--

You must have the docbook DTDs installed on your computer.  On many
distros, there are some docbook packages to install them easily.

Download docbook XSL stylesheets from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/ .  Install them anywhere you
want then add a symlink to them called docbook in xsl/ folder.


DB2LaTeX
--

Download DB2LaTeX XSL stylesheets from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/db2latex/ .  Install them anywhere you
want then add a symlink to them called db2latex in xsl/ folder.


PDFLatex
--

You have to install PDFLatex to generate the pdf output. It's
distributed in tetex-latex package.  I personally installed a lot of
tetex packages as I don't know which ones I really need :).


Documentation tools in Debian
--

For HTML documentation tools, run:

  # apt-get install docbook-xml docbook-xsl libxml2-utils xsltproc

Then making the symbolic link is like that (in docs/docbook/xsl):

  $ ln -s /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh docbook

For PDF documentation tools, run:

  # apt-get install db2latex-xsl tetex-extra latex-ucs

Then make the symbolic link (in docs/docbook/xsl):

  $ mkdir db2latex
  $ ln -s /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/db2latex/latex db2latex/xsl

All these steps are automated in the Makefile by using sudo:

  $ make debianhtml
  $ make debianpdf
  $ make debian      # runs both debianhtml and debianpdf
