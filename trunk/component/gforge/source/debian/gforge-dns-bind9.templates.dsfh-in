_Description: Do you want a simple DNS setup for GForge?
 You can use a simple DNS setup with wildcards to map all
 project web-hosts to a single IP address, and direct all the scm-hosts
 to a single SCM server, or a complex setup which allows
 many servers as project web servers or SCM servers.
 .
 Even if you use a simple DNS setup, you can still use
 separate machines as project servers; it just assumes that
 all the project web directories are on the same server with a single
 SCM server.
