scmcvs plugin
-------------

This is the CVS plugin for Gforge.  It creates CVS repositories and
provides some functionality to manage them.

The scmcvs/etc/plugins/scmcvs/config.php should be copied and edited
to

        /etc/gforge/plugins/scmcvs/config.php

The 'Site Admin' tab on the GForge web interface now has a 'Plugin Manager'
page where you can activate plugins on a sitewide basis. Be sure to do that
if you want this plugin to be available to projects.
