This is a port of phpwiki 1.3.12 to be used as plugin in gforge.

This plugin provides a full wiki for each project and also a personal wiki for people who wants one.

Currently, only postgresql is supported.

To use this plugin, you have to:

1) add in your apache file:

========== BEGIN
        <Location /wiki/g>
                ForceType application/x-httpd-php
                AcceptPathInfo on
        </Location>
        <Location /wiki/u>
                ForceType application/x-httpd-php
                AcceptPathInfo on
        </Location>
========== END

2) Allow write access to your gforge/www directory (or install the link manually).
