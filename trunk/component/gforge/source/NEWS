Release notes for FusionForge 4.7
---------------------------------

This is the first public release of FusionForge.  FusionForge is based
on GForge, and started as an identical copy, with only a name change
to avoid confusion with the proprietary versions of GForge (known as
GForge Advanced Server or GForge AS).  As such, it benefits from
mature code and known-good infrastructure, and builds on it for the
future.

This 4.7 release is focused on bringing the recent evolutions out to
the community in an official stable release.  This should provide a
solid base as a starting point for community-based development, making
it easier for enhancements to be maintained.  The FusionForge name was
chosen to reflect this: this is a community effort, and we hope to
hear about your improvements.  Contributing these improvements would
make their future long-term maintenance easier for everyone.

Major changes since previous versions (of GForge) include:
-  Support for PHP5.
-  Support for PostgreSQL 8.x.
-  Translations are now managed by gettext.
-  Support for several configurations running on the same code.
-  Improved security, no need for PHP register_globals.
-  Available as full install CD.
-  New wiki plugins (using MediaWiki or phpWiki).
-  New online_help plugin.
-  New phpwebcalendar plugin.
-  New project hierarchy plugin.

Things to keep in mind when installing:
- FusionForge is based on GForge, and the renaming is quite recent.
  So the code still contains lots of references to GForge.  This will
  be fixed as time passes.
- Full text search using the primitives provided by PostgreSQL 8.3
  isn't quite complete yet.
- Not all plugins are packaged for all distributions yet.

Things to keep in mind when upgrading:
- Since internationalisation was changed from a hand-made system to
  standard gettext, locally customised translations will no longer
  override standard ones.  This will be addressed in a future release.
