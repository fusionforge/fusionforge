	*Base class for adding multilingual support to SF.net

	*Contains variables which can be overridden optionally by other
	language files.

	*Base language is english - an english class will extend this one,
	but won't override anything

	*As new languages are added, they can override what they wish, and 
		as we extend our class, other languages can follow suit
		as they are translated without holding up our progress

Registering a project with Sourceforge is an easy process, but we
do require a lot of information in order to automate things as much as
possible. The entire process should take about 10 minutes.
				
<P>
During signup, we will present you with some legal documents regarding
your account with us. Please do not ignore these; they are very
important to you and your project.

<H2>Step 1: SourceForge Services & Requirements (Service Specific Rules)</H2>

<p>
We are now offering a full suite of services for Sourceforge projects. If
you haven\'t already, please be sure to browse the most recent revision of
the Sourceforge Services.
</p>

<p>
<b>Use of Project Account</b>
</p>

<p>
The space given to you on the original Sourceforge servers is given
for the expressed purpose of Open Source development or, in the case
of web sites, the advancement of Open Source.  The space given to you
on this server, on the other hand, is given for the expressed purpose
of whatever the local Sourceforge maintainer has decided.
</p>

<p>
<b>Creative Freedom</b>
</p>

<p>
It is the intent of the Sourceforge software to allow you creative
freedom on your project.  However, for the legal protection of this
site and yours there might be limits imposed by the local Sourceforge
administrator.  Details about these restrictions are described in the
Terms of Service.
</p>

<p>
<b>Advertisements</b>
</p>

<p>
You may not place any revenue-generating advertisements on a site
hosted at sourceforge.net.  Contact the local Sourceforge
administrator about the present site.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sourceforge Link</b>
</p>

<p>
If you host a web site at this Sourceforge site, you might want to
place one of our approved graphic images on your site with a link back
to the Sourceforge site.  The graphic may either link to the main
Sourceforge site or to your project page on the site.  For information
about how to insert a SourceForge logo which will track your
pageviews, please read the Sourceforge documentation.  Again, this
condition is subject to the will of the local Sourceforge
administrator.
</p>

<p>
<b>Open Source/Rights to Code</b>
</p>

<p>
You will be presented with a choice of licenses for your project.
Some of them are Open Source approved, some are not.  The ones that
are Open Source approved also allow us to make your code available to
the general public: although you may choose to stop hosting your
project with us, the nature of these licenses will allow us to
continue to make your code available.  It is therefore advised to
think twice before you choose a license, especially if you choose one
the local Sourceforge administrator might have added to the default
ones.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to use another license that is not currently listed, let
the local Sourceforge administrator know and he will review these
requests on a case-by-case basis.
</p>

<p>
It is the intent of the software to provide a permanent home for all
versions of your code.  The Sourceforge administrator does reserve the
right, however, to terminate your project if there is due cause, in
accordance with the Terms of Service.

<H2>Step 3: SourceForge Project Registration</H2>

<p>We now need a short description of your project. This description
needs to contain the purpose of the project and a summarization of your
goals.

<p>
If the local Sourceforge administrator approves your project account,
the account is to be used purely to meet the goals set forth in this
statement.  Use of the project account for anything other than the
purposes and goals in this statement is probably prohibited by local
policy.  If you need to change this statement at any time, please

<P>We now need some basic technical information for your project.
There are two types of names that will be associated with this project.

<P>The \"Full Name\" is descriptive, has no real name restrictions (except
a 40 character limit), and
can be changed. The \"Unix Name\" has several restrictions because it is
used in so many places around the site. They are:

<UL>
<LI>Cannot match the unix name of any other project
<LI>Must be between 3 and 15 characters in length
<LI>Can only contain characters, numbers, and dashes
<LI>Must be a valid unix username

SourceForge was created to advance Open Source software development.
To keep things simple, the original SourceForge crew are relying on
the outstanding work of the <A href="http://www.opensource.org">Open
Source Initiative</A> for their licensing choices.

<p>Local policy may require the availability of other licenses,
though.  This should be handled by the local Sourceforge
administrator.  If you wish to use a license that is not listed here,
please let the administrator know why you wish to use another license.

<P>Choosing a license is a serious decision. Please take some time to
read the text (and our explanations) of several licenses before making
a choice abour your project.

<P>For many legal reasons, you may not change a project\'s license once
it has been set. If you feel that you have a special case and legal
capability to do this, we will work with you on a case-by-case basis.
