about	about_blurb	<h2>About Sourceforge</h2>This site runs Debian Sourceforge, a derivative of the code that runs the <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge.net</a>.  The information present on this page is only authoritative for Debian Sourceforge, please refer to <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge.net</a> for information on their code.<br><br><b>People</b><br>The Sourceforge <a href="staff.php">staff</a> has worked hard to make Sourceforge a reality, here's your chance to meet the people behind the site.<br><br><b>Thanks</b><br>We owe a lot of thanks to the people that wrote the software that runs Sourceforge.  We'd also like to give <a href="thanks.php">Kudos</a> to the following people and organizations for helping make Sourceforge happen.<br><br><b>More Information</b><br>If you have further questions, please contact the <a href="http://mail.freesoftware.fsf.org/mailman/listinfo/debian-sf-users">Debian Sourceforge users mailing-list</a>.

users	title	User Summary
users	peerinfo1	If you are familiar with this user, please take a moment to rate him/her on the following criteria. Keep in mind, that your rating will be visible to the user and others.  <P> The $1 Peer Rating system is based on concepts from <A HREF="http://www.advogato.com">Advogato.</A> The system has been re-implemented and expanded in a few ways.
users	peerinfo2	The Peer rating box shows all rating averages (and response levels) for each individual criteria. Due to the math and processing required to do otherwise, these numbers incoporate responses from both "trusted" and "non-trusted" users.  <ul> <li> The "Sitewide Rank" field shows the user's rank compared to all ranked $1 users.  <li>The "Aggregate Score" shows an average, weighted overall score, based on trusted-responses only.  <li>The "Personal Importance" field shows the weight that users ratings of other developers will be given (between 1 and 1.5) -- higher rated user's responses are given more weight.  </ul> <p> <i> If you would like to opt-out from peer rating system (this will affect your ability to both rate and be rated), refer to <a href="/account/">your account maintenance page</a>. If you choose not to participate, your ratings of other users will be permanently deleted and the 'Peer Rating' box will disappear from your user page. </i></p>
users	optout	You opted-out from peer rating system, otherwise you would have a chance to rate the user. Refer to <a href="/account/">your account maintenance page</a> for more information.
