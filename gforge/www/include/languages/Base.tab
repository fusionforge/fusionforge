help_tracker	close_window	Close Window
help_tracker	data_type	The Data Type option determines the type of tracker item this is.  Since the tracker rolls into one the bug, patch, support, etc... managers you need to be able to determine which one of these an item should belong.<br /><br />This has the added benefit of enabling an admin to turn a support request into a bug.
help_tracker	priority	The priority option allows a user to define a tracker item priority (ranging from 1-Lowest to 5-Highest).<br /><br />This is especially helpful for bugs and support requests where a user might find a critical problem with a project.
help_tracker	monitor	You can monitor or un-monitor this item by clicking the "Monitor" button. <br /><br /><strong>Note!</strong> this will send you additional email. If you add comments to this item, or submitted, or are assigned this item, you will also get emails for those reasons as well!
help_tracker	sort_by	The Sort By option allows you to determine how the browse results are sorted.<br /><br />  You can sort by ID, Priority, Summary, Open Date, Close Date, Submitter, or Assignee.  You can also have the results sorted in Ascending or Descending order.
help_tracker	status	This drop-down box represents the current status of a tracker item.<br /><br />You can set the status to 'Pending' if you are waiting for a response from the tracker item author.  When the author responds the status is automatically reset to that of 'Open'. Otherwise, if the author doesn't respond with an admin-defined amount of time (default is 14 days) then the item is given a status of 'Deleted'.
help_tracker	summary	The summary text-box represents a short tracker item summary. Useful when browsing through several tracker items.
help_tracker	unknown_help_request	UNKNOWN HELP REQUEST:
