	* include/User.class: getUnixStatus() added.

        * admin/approve_pending.php: Added LDAP support. For this,

        fields are shown somewhat cleaner. Since data now doubled
        between SQL and LDAP, steps to detect inconsistencies are
        performed with (hopefully) proper diagnostics (including
        preserving LDAP error descriptions in status_comment of
        group) and rudimentary auto-repair.
