  <p> 
    Select your parameters for querying the CVS commit database in the
    form at the top of the page.  You
    can search for multiple matches by typing a comma-seperated list
    into the text fields.  Regular expressions, and wildcards are also
    supported.  Blank text input fields are treated as wildcards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any of the text entry fields can take a comma-seperated list of
    search arguments.  For example, to search for all commits from
    authors <em>jpaint</em> and <em>gstein</em>, just type: <code>jpaint,
    gstein</code> in the <em>Author</em> input box.  If you are searching
    for items containing spaces or quotes, you will need to quote your
    request.  For example, the same search above with quotes is:
    <code>"jpaint", "gstein"</code>.
  </p>
  <p>                           
    Wildcard and regular expression searches are entered in a similar
    way to the quoted requests.  You must quote any wildcard or
    regular expression request, and a command character preceeds the
    first quote.  The command character <code>l</code>(lowercase L) is for wildcard
    searches, and the wildcard character is a percent (<code>%</code>).  The
    command character for regular expressions is <code>r</code>, and is
    passed directly to MySQL, so you'll need to refer to the MySQL
    manual for the exact regex syntax.  It is very similar to Perl.  A
    wildard search for all files with a <em>.py</em> extention is:
    <code>l"%.py"</code> in the <em>File</em> input box.  The same search done
    with a regular expression is: <code>r".*\.py"</code>.
  </p>
  <p>                  
    All search types can be mixed, as long as they are seperated by
    commas.
