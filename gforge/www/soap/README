This file contains instructions for setting and and configuring the GForge 
SOAP server.

Server Setup

1. Extract the tar file into the root GForge directory.  For example, if
your root diectory is /usr/share/gforge/www, then

	cd /usr/lib/gforge/www ; tar xvf {tarfile}

should work.  This will create a soap directory underneath the root directory
and there should be 5 files plus one sub-directory:

README - this README file
SoapAPI.php - the PHP file that defines the SOAP functions
nusoap.php  - the SOAP implementation provided by NuSOAP people (0.65)
pre_soap.php - The includes from GForge directory for access to GForge system
	I couldn't use (and didn't want to use) the pre.php file
SoapAPI.wsdl - There is a bug in the nusoap WSDL generator so this file was
	hand created for consumption by WSDL enabled tools (like Visual 
	Studio .NET)
api	- The directory containing the TCL scripts.  Currently one very short
	  but functional TCL script is provided to get you started
api/apiInit.tcl - The TCL script

Once these are set up, you can use the WSDL file to connect and test two of 
the SOAP functions.  One function is a simple string echo engine that echoes 
back whatever you send it plus some extra text.  The other function defined 
in the WSDL file gives access to the User database in GForge.  You pass in
an array of strings to the 'user' function and it will return an array of
strings back for each user in the input array.  For example, passing in
the array 'bob','ted','mary' will return the user objects for these 3 users.
If you pass in an empty list, you will get back all users.


Command Line Setup
-----------------

The command line is based on TCL so you will need to install several TCL 
components beforehand.

TclX8.3     
	apt-get tclx8.3

TclDOM 2.0  
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/showfiles.php?group_id=131&release_id=127168

TclLib 1.0  <--------* Must be 1.0 Do not get higher versions !!!
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tcllib/tcllib-1.0.tar.gz?download

TclSOAP    
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/showfiles.php?group_id=25970&release_id=40865


Once these are installled properly, you should launch TCL from the shell.
At the 'tcl>' prompt, source in the TCL script with

tcl> source apiInit.tcl

(the 'tcl>' prompt is shown for clarity.  You can enter full path to the 
script file if you are not in the same directory as the script file
when you started the TCL interpreter.

The TCL script provides 3 functions, 


---------------
hello {arg}  Sends a SOAP 'hello' action to the soap server

EXAMPLES
	hello WORLD
---------------
user get {user-list}  sends a SOAP 'user' request to the SOAP server with
	a function code of 'get' followed by a list os unix_user_names to fetch

EXAMPLES
	user get [list bob mary ted]   # returns up to three users
	user get [list ]     # retruns all users

---------------
group get {group-list}  sends a SOAP 'group' request to the SOAP server with
	a function code of 'get' followed by a list of group_names to fetch

EXAMPLES
	group get [list stats siteadmin]
	group get [list all]

(NOTE that the group function requires an arg list, cannot be empty list)
