<h2 id="sec-history">The History of ViewVC</h2>

<p>The ViewVC software was inspired by <a
   href="http://people.freebsd.org/~fenner/cvsweb/">cvsweb</a>
   (originally written by Bill Fenner and then further developed by <a
   href="mailto:zeller@think.de">Henner Zeller</a>).  Greg Stein
   wanted to make some changes and updates, but cvsweb was implemented
   in Perl.  He wrote:</p>

<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">&quot;While I can manage some
   Perl, cvsweb was rather unmaintainable for me. So I undertook the
   task to convert the software to Python. As a result, I've actually
   been able to go <em>way</em> beyond the simple changes that I had
   envisioned.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>So ViewVC started out as just a port of the cvsweb script,
   originally called ViewCVS.  Along the way, it has had numerous
   cleanups and other modifications, a process simplified by the
   elegance of the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
   language.</p>

<p>In 2001, the ViewCVS project was moved to <a
   href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>, a popular
   software collaboration environment.  There the project continued to
   mature, releasing several stable-yet-pre-1.0 versions.  In 2002,
   C. Michael Pilato began implementing support for Subversion in
   ViewCVS, building atop the beginnings of a version control
   abstraction layer begun by Lucas Bruand.  Along the way, Russell
   Yanofsky delivered large improvements to that abstraction, and to
   ViewCVS as whole.  ViewCVS was well on its way to releasing a 1.0
   version.</p>

<p>Of course, now that ViewCVS could browse Subversion repositories as
   easily as CVS ones, the ViewCVS name seemed inappropriate.  Also,
   SourceForge's lack of support for Subversion (which was already
   well past its 1.0 release, and becoming hugely popular) in its
   project version control offerings was annoying ViewCVS primary
   developers.  So in late 2005, the decision was made to rename the
   project to ViewVC, to convert the project's CVS data to Subversion,
   and to move the project and its Subversion data to <a
   href="http://www.tigris.org">Tigris.org</a>.</p>

<p>Today, ViewVC is being developed at <a
   href="http://viewvc.tigris.org">http://viewvc.tigris.org</a> by a
   small community of folks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sec-site-credits">About This Site</h2>

<p>The ViewVC website was designed by <a
   href="http://www.cmichaelpilato.com/">C. Michael Pilato</a>.  All
   HTML was hand-edited in Emacs, and the little splashes of graphical
   goodness owe their existence to Adobe PhotoShop.  Textual content
   for the site is mostly the work of Greg Stein, but has been tweaked
   through the ages by various ViewVC contributors.</p>
