Public Domain

If you want to make no restrictions at all, you should put your software in the
public domain. An appropriate way to do this would be to include something like
the following text at the head of each file:

Placed in public domain by J. Random Hacker, 1997.  Share and enjoy!

If you do this, you are surrendering your copyright. Anyone can do anything
they like with any part of the text. It doesn't get any freer than this.
