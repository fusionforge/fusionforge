<p>This is an contributor guide to the SourceForge software as found
on <a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=1>SourceForge</a>.
It explains how contributors should behave in order to see their 
patches accepted by the administrators of the project.
It assumes that you've successfully installed the software as described
in <a href=Install_Guide.html>SourceForge-1.0.4 Installation Guide</a> and
that you're running your own instance as explained in <a href=Adminstration_Guide.html>SourceForge-1.0.4 Administrator Guide</a>

<P>
You must understand that integration of any kind of modification to the
code is subject to carefull reviewing by the SourceForge team. They will
ultimately be responsible for bugs or security problems, not you. At
present patches are processed using the patch manager and it is expected
that <b>very</b> few people will have write access to the CVS repository.

<P>
At present no software roadmap exists and no regression tests are implemented
and therefore the following rules cannot apply fully. Hopefully a contributor
will make these two happen.

<P><B>Etiquette</B><P>

<UL>
<LI> Whatever your coding style is, mimic exactly the existing
     style. Period. Here are some hints:
     <UL>
     <LI> Use tabulations instead of white space for indentation.
     </UL>
<LI> Fully review the code roadmap before modifying anything.
     If you discover things that are not in the roadmap, contribute to
     the roadmap document with updates or additions.
<LI> Search carefully the forums and mailing list archives for discussions
     related to the contribution/bugfix you're willing to make.
<LI> Read all the code in www/include at least once and understand its
     purpose. This is the library and you don't want to re-implement anything
     it contains.
<LI> Always update the ChangeLog file and be very precise.
</UL>

<P><B>New functionalities</B><P>

So, you're absolutely sure the functionality is not already implemented, 
that it's not a task in progress. You should now convince at least one
person in the developper community that it's worth doing.
<P>
Describe what you're planning to do in the forum.
Precisely describe algorithms, functionalities. Wait for approval from 
another developper. In the meantime you can implement what you have in 
mind.
<P>

<UL>
<LI> Add the task in the task list and update daily.
<LI> Implement the functionality.
<LI> Write a non-regression test for it.
<LI> Run the non-regression tests for all the software until it says ok.
<LI> Update the SourceForge documentation and roadmap to describe the new functionality.
</UL>

<P><B>Bug Fixing</B><P>

<UL>
<LI> Assign the bug to yourself in the bug list. Never work on a bug
   assigned to someone else, unless you're talking to the other
   developper.
<LI> Write a non-regression test for it. Should it pop again, the test
   must detect it.
<LI> Fix the problem.
<LI> Run the non-regression tests for all the software until it says ok.
</UL>
