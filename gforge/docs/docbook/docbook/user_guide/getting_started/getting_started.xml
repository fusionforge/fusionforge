						You should select an unique user name to access to the system. The name should not contain uppercase letters and usually is a combination of your name and your surname; e.g. jdoe for John Doe.

				<term>Password</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						You should insert your password here. It must be at least 6 characters long. You shouldn't use too obvious names for the password. It should be easy to remember for you, but hard to guess for others. So don't use the name of your dog, of your cat, or the name of your birth city.
