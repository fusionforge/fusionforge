<h2>Migrating to GForge HOWTO</h2>
<h3>Updated 1/19/2004</h3>
</center>

<p>Lots of people are moving from various other SourceForge
codebases to GForge. Here's some notes on how to do this. Please post
comments/questions/improvements to the <a
	href="http://gforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=6">forums</a>.
<p><b>SF 2.5 or SF 2.6 to GForge</b> <br>
<p>The basic steps are:
<ul>
	<li>First run a <code>apt-get install
	gforge-sourceforge-transition</code>. This dumps the database into <code>/var/lib/sourceforge/sf_dump_for_gforge</code>.


	
	<li>Now <code>mv /var/lib/sourceforge /var/lib/gforge</code>
	<li>Now run a <code>apt-get install gforge</code>. This will find
	the database dump and import it automagically.
	<li>If all goes well, <code>/var/lib/gforge/sf_dump_for_gforge</code>
	will be renamed <code>/var/lib/gforge/sf_dump_for_gforge.ok</code>. If
	something fails, it'll be renamed to <code>/var/lib/gforge/sf_dump_for_gforge.ko</code>.


	
	<li>Note that <code>apt-get install gforge</code> will also remove
	the <code>gforge-sourceforge-transition</code> package.
</ul>

This has been done - see <a

thread on the forums. Looks like there are some database changes which
might cause problems; not sure what those are.
