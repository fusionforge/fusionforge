<section name="GForge homepage">
<p>
Connect with your browser to GForge. This can be either gforge.org or a locally-installed version of the software.

</p>
</section>


<section name="Registering as a new user">
<p>
To register a new user, click on the New Account button on the top right side of the browser window.
<p/>
To register as a user, you need to fill out the form with the following data:
<ul>
<li><b>Login Name</b><br/>
You should select an unique user name to access to the system. The name should not contain uppercase letters and usually is a combination of your name and your surname; e.g. juser for John User.  Also, the user name cannot match that of an existing system user account - i.e., you can't have a GForge user named 'root'.
 </li>
<li><b>Password</b>
<br/>
You should insert your password here. It must be at least 6 chars long. You shouldn't use too obvious names for the password. It should be easy to remember for you, but hard to guess for others. So don't use the name of your dog, of your cat, or the name of your birth city.  
<br/>
You should use instead a combination of letters and numbers. 

 </li>
<li><b>Full/Real Name</b><br/>
Here you should insert your full name.
</li>
<li><b>Language Choice</b><br/>
Select here your preferred language.   This choice does not influence only the language in which gforge will speak to you, but also some local specific data display, like dates, etc.

</li>
<li><b>Timezone</b><br/>
Select your timezone. Note that GMT is preselected. All dates will be showed relative to your timezone.

</li>
<li><b>Email Address</b><br/>

You should insert your email address here.<br/>
The email address should be correct, gforge will send you a confirmation email for your subscription. If the email address you're inserting here is wrong, you'll never receive the confirmation email and the account you're registering will never be activated.
<br/>
When you receive the confirmation email, you must connect to gforge using the provided URL in the email. This is the only way to become a registered user.


</li>

<li><b>Receive Email about Site Updates</b><br/>
If you check this, you'll periodically receive information about the gforge site. The traffic is very low, it is recommended that you activate this option.
</li>
<li><b>Receive additional community mailings</b><br/>

</li>

</ul>

</p>

<section name="Registering a new project">
<p>
To register a new project, connect to your gforge and add the register/path to the URL
<p/>
You need to insert the following information to register a project:

<p/>
<ul>
<li><b>Project Full Name</b><br/>
The Name of the Project: eg. Gforge Master project</li>
<li><b>Project Purpose and Summarization</b><br/>
A brief summary of the Project</li>
<li><b>License</b><br/>
You must select a License for your software.
</li>
<li><b>Project Public Description</b><br/>
Insert a description of the Project. This description will appear in the Project Summary page</li>
<li><b>Project Unix Name</b><br/>
Insert here the unix name of your project. This name must respect the following rules:
<ol>
<li>it cannot match the unix name of any other project</li>
<li>its length must be between 3 and 15 characters</li>
<li>it must be in lowercase</li>
<li>only characters, numbers and dashes are accepted</li> 
</ol>
<p/>
The unix name will be used for your website, the CVS Repository and the shell access for gforge.
<p/>
Note: the unix name will never change. Once a project is set up with its unix name, the name cannot be changed.
</li>
</ul>
<p/>
Click on the I agree button to register the project. Your project is now registered on gforge; but you cannot yet access it. It has to be approved from the site administrators.
<br/>
When the project is approved, you'll receive an email from gforge confirming that the project is active.
