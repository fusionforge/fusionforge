  <body>

<section name="Tasks">
<p>
The Task Manager is similar to the tracker, with the following differences:
<ol>
<li>you can insert the start date of the item</li>
<li>you can insert the end date of the item</li>
<li>you can insert the number of hours for the item</li>
<li>you can have multiple assignees for the item</li>
<li>you can handle dependencies between tasks</li>
</ol> 

Tasks are organized on subprojects. Before inserting a new task, you must first create a subproject. You can use the "Admin" link to create new subprojects.

Tasks allows you to create and manage tasks, or blocks of work, 
similar to the way projects are broken down in eg MS Project.

<section name="Inserting a new Task">

This allows you to add tasks to the sub projects - e.g. Write Design Doc, 
Review Doc, Update Doc, Write Code, Review Code, Update Code, Test, Log Test 
Results, etc. They can be assigned to members of the team, and start and end 
dates set up for them, dependencies on other tasks set, percentage 
completion etc.
