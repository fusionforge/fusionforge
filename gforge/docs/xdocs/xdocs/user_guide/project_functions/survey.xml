<section name="Introduction">
<p>
Surveys allow you to ask questions to your developer/users and view the results. Surveys are often very helpful if you
need some feedback from the users, examples of surveys might be:
<ol>
<li>User feedback: ask users if they like your project</li>
<li>Developer feedback: ask developers on new features to be implemented</li>
</ol>
Of course, surveys are not limited to this list. Basically, you can ask everything you want with surveys.

<section name="Administering survey questions">
<p>
Before you can add/modify existing surveys, you need to administer the questions for your surveys. Questions are global
for all surveys.

Gforge surveys handle the following question types:
<ol>
<li>Radio Buttons 1-5: This type of question shows 5 radio buttons where the user can select between 1 (low) and 5 (high).
This is useful for indicating priorities or quality feedback (e.g.: the question might be: did you like the new xxx feature. The user can select (1 (not very much), 2,3,4, 5(really)</li>
<li>Radio Buttons Yes/No. This type of question allows only two choices: Yes or No.</li>
<li>Comment Only</li>
<li>Text field: This type of question allows the user to insert some text in a text field.</li>
<li>Text area: This type of question allows the user to insert some text in a textarea</li>
</ol>

When inserting new questions or modifying existing questions, take note of the ID of the question. You'll need them when creating/modifying surveys.
