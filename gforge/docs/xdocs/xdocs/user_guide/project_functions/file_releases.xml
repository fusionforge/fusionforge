<section name="Introduction">
<p>
The File Releases System (FRS) is used to upload files to the gforge site and to make these files available to the users in an easy and efficient way.
<br/>
Files can be divided in different packages, and every single package can be monitored by the users; these users will receive an email every time a new file has been added to the package.
<br/>
For information on how to create new packages and release new files, refer to the Project Administration Guide.
