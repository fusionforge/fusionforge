<p>
There are several ways to contribute to the Gforge project. The first and the easiest one is to give us a feedback about the software. 
<br/>

<ol>
<li>If you find a bug, submit a bug to the Bug tracker at http://gforge.org. If you know how to solve the bug, you can attach a patch to the bug. </li>
<li>If you have developed some new feature, submit a patch to the patch manager of gforge. The submitted patch should follow the Coding and Templating standards described in this document. </li>
<li>Documentation: there are some parts of Gforge that are not well documented. Refer to the Task Manager, Documentation subproject for a list of open tasks. You should write the documentation in the xdoc format as described in this section.</li>
<li>Localization: Gforge needs to be translated in various languages. <br/>Refer to the Localization Howto document to see how to add a new language</li>
</ol>
