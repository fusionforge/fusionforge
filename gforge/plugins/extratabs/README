Presentation
------------

This plugin has been written for Gforge 4.5. The plugin add a new page
"Extra tabs" in the "group admin" page. There you can create new tabs that
will appear on all project pages.

The purpose is to let people point to external resources related to the
project. For example, a project might use an external bugzilla and they
want to point people there.

The administrators of projects can now add such links. They must simply
give an URL and a name.

Installation
------------

This is valid Debian source package. You can use "fakeroot debian/rules
binary" or "debuild -us -uc" to generate a Debian package.

If you're not using Debian, then please read debian/rules and work out
where the files need to be copied (it's very easy). :-)

Requirements
------------

This plugin needs a hook called 'groupadminmenu' which has been added to
the CVS repository after the release of Gforge 4.5:
http://gforge.org/plugins/scmcvs/cvsweb.php/gforge/www/project/admin/project_admin_utils.php.diff?r1=1.18;r2=1.19;cvsroot=gforge

You can apply this diff manually however if needed.
