These new scripts and files allow you to do away completely with
CVS and the editing of the /etc/passwd /etc/groups and /etc/shadow files
(or LDAP auth server).

Instead we can use the new module libapache2-mod-auth-gforge in conjunction
with Subversion, DAV, mod_dav, mod_dav_svn, and mod_authz_svn.

Sounds complex, doesn't it? There's a lot of stuff to install, but the 
scripts are quite clear and flexible.

A sample crontab is at crontab.in and sample httpd.conf is here as well.

Here's what you get:

User DAV-accesible space:
   Home directories, public and shareable for each user:
   /var/www/homedirs/users/*user_name*/

   Home pages for Users (http://*user_name*.users.gforge.company.com)
   /var/www/homedirs/users/*user_name*/www

   Private DAV directories for each user
   /var/www/homedirs/users/*user_name*/private

Group DAV space:
   Home directories, public and shareable for each group:
   /var/www/homedirs/groups/*group_name*

   Home pages for Groups (http://*group_name*.groups.gforge.company.com)
   /var/www/homedirs/groups/*group_name*

Group DAV/Subversion Document Repository
   Each project has its own subversion repository for document storage
   /var/docman/*group_name*/ is where the repositories are
   /var/www/docman is the DOCUMENT_ROOT for apache
   Access them at (http://doc.gforge.company.com/*group_name*)

Group DAV/Subversion Source Code Repository
   Each project has its own subversion repository for source code
   /var/svn/*group_name*/ is where the repositories are
