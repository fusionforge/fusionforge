gforge-plugin-ldapextauth
-------------------------

This is the external LDAP authentication plugin for Gforge.

Prerequisite:

- install Perl, DBI and DBD::Pg as per Gforge's INSTALL file

Installation:

- files from etc/ go to /etc/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth
- files from bin/ go to /usr/share/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth/bin
- files from include/ go to /usr/share/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth/include

Setup:

- customise files in /etc/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth to match your
LDAP installation (server, base DN, and mapping)
- /usr/share/gforge/plugins/ldapextauth/bin/db-upgrade.pl
- /usr/share/gforge/bin/register-plugin ldapextauth "LDAP external authentication"

Voilà, you can now log into Gforge with your existing loginname and
password.  Your account will be created the first time you log in
(which means you can't add someone to a group before his/her first
login).
