This is a port of phpwiki 1.3.14-svn to be used as plugin in gforge.

This plugin provides a full wiki for each projects with:
  * A full integration.
  * One wiki per project.
  * A search integrated in the forge search.
  * Page edits are displayed on the activaty tab.
  * Wiki Preferences are across projects.

Currently, only postgresql is supported.

To use this plugin, you have to:

1) Install tsearch2 to the fforge database (if not already installed).

su - postgres -c "psql fforge" < /usr/share/pgsql/contrib/tsearch2.sql 
su - postgres -c "psql fforge -c 'GRANT ALL on pg_ts_cfg TO gforge'"
su - postgres -c "psql fforge -c 'GRANT ALL on pg_ts_cfgmap TO gforge'"
su - postgres -c "psql fforge -c 'GRANT ALL on pg_ts_dict TO gforge'"
su - postgres -c "psql fforge -c 'GRANT ALL on pg_ts_parser TO gforge'"

2) Add a symbolic link from the gforge/www/wiki to the gforge/plugins/wiki/www

example (for installs in /opt/gforge):
# ln -s ../plugins/wiki/www /opt/gforge/www/wiki 

3) Activate the plugin by the web (with init checked).

4) Add in your apache file(s):

========== BEGIN
        <Location /wiki/g>
                php_admin_flag register_long_arrays on 
                ForceType application/x-httpd-php
        </Location>
        
        <Location "/www">
		        Options -ExecCGI -FollowSymLinks
		        DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm
		        php_admin_flag engine off
		        php_admin_value open_basedir /opt/groups/
        </Location>

        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteRule     ^/www/([^/]*)/(.*) /opt/groups/$1/www/$2 [L]
========== END

5) Add the following cronjob:

12 * * * * root $PHP $GFORGE/plugins/wiki/cronjobs/create_groups.php /opt

NOTES: 
1) Personal wikis are no longer available but can be re-activated quite easily by
 cloning configuration on g to u, changing the prefix and adding the same kind of
 configuration at apache level.

2) By default, phpWiki creates lots of pages with plugins and helps. The current 
 implementation allows to create a full wiki (with all standard pages) or one big
 and the others with minimal pages (see configuration file for more).

PROBLEMS:
* If you have PearDB problems and if you have a peardb package already installed, then
you can try to remove it. By default, phpwiki will try to use the installed one and
failback to the embedded one if none found.

* You may also have problems with the tsearch configuration. phpWiki uses full text
search to provide an improved search and you have to check that the configuration
is supported by the installed locale on your system.
Here is an example of command if your installed locale is fr_FR.UTF-8:
SQL: UPDATE pg_ts_cfg set locale = 'fr_FR.UTF-8' WHERE ts_name = 'default';
