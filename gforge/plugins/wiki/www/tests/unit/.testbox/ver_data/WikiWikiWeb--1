content. The most well-known and widely used Wiki is the Portland
Pattern Repository at http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?WikiWikiWeb.

You and I will find these statements there particularly relevant:

''The point is to make the EditText form simple and the FindPage
search fast.''

''In addition to being quick, this site also aspires to Zen ideals
generally labeled WabiSabi. Zen finds beauty in the imperfect and
ephemeral. When it comes down to it, that's all you need.''

''The Universe tends toward chaos. The Universe tends toward Wiki.''

You can say hello on RecentVisitors, or read about HowToUseWiki and
AddingPages. Currently this Wiki has no theme for discussion, so go
ahead and play with it and have fun!!
