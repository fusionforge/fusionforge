!!! What is a ModeratedPage?

A ModeratedPage is a page-internal setting, which restricts certain actions on certain pages.
The requested action and page is stored internally and an email is sent to the moderators
described in the linked and locked ModeratedPage action page.
Any moderator may approve or reject the action by simply clicking an url.
When approving the action, the requested action (edit, rename, ...) is performed.

In both cases the author is notified, so it's recommended for the
moderator to click on either the approve or reject links in the moderation email.
In case of multiple moderators: first comes, first serves.

!!! How to enable ModeratedPage on a single page?

* Check the status of this action page, esp. the moderators in the
  plugin line, if they had their emails stored in their
  UserPreferences, and if the action page is locked.
* Add a link to this action page in the page(s) in question.
* Save the page.
* Lock the page to actually change the moderation status. You may want to unlock it then.

!!! How to disable ModeratedPage on a single page?

* Remove the link to this action page in the page(s) in question.
* Save the page.
* Lock the page to actually change the moderation status. You may want to unlock it then.

!!! Plugin Arguments

* moderators: comma seperated list of registered usernames or groups.
  Each user should have his email defined in his prefs. Default: "Administrators" or
  <?plugin SystemInfo ADMIN_USER ?>
* requirelevel: one of 0, 1, 2 or 10 on which moderation is used. Default: false (use requireaccess instead)
* requireaccess: comma separated list of access perms, on which the moderation is used
  "view,edit,create,list,remove,change"
  Default: edit,remove,change

!!! How does it work internally?

You need to lock the page additionally, so that the link parser performs
some magic whether the ModeratedPage link is present or not, for efficiency
reasons. It can be unlocked again, and even the ModeratedPage link may be removed.
The status will only be changed on the *lock* action, whether the ModeratedPage
link is present or not.

The moderation status is stored in each page in question.
Each moderated action is stored in the page also, together with a randomly
created permission key to allow Grant by a simple external unauthorized request.
There's no timeout on moderated actions, so the actions may stack up.
The delayed actions may be performed in any order, there's no strict ordering to
follow for the moderator.

!!! How to enable ModeratedPage on multiple/all pages?

If you enable the config option ENABLE_MODERATEDPAGE_ALL, the page moderation status on
every page is automatically set to check this action page ModeratedPage.

There may come another administrative plugin to change the moderation
status on selected pages.
