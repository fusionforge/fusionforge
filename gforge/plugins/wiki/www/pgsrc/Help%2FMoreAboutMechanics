PhpWiki is written in the server-side scripting language PHP,
available from http://www.php.net/. PHP resembles C and Perl in its
syntax, and functions much like ASP, ~EmbPerl or JSP.

PhpWiki consists of a dozen or so files of mixed PHP and HTML. The web
pages that make up a [WikiWikiWeb] based on PHP live in a database with
backup copies of previous versions of pages stored as well. (For the
database, PhpWiki works with DBM, MySQL, PostgreSQL or text files.)

Every time a user hits the site, the page requested is pulled from the
database and rendered on the fly. The user only really ever requests
the file =index.php=, which then decides which other php files to
include.

Links to pages in the Wiki are automatically linked: AddingPages.
This might be the single most compelling aspect of a Wiki, the ability
to add pages simply by linking to them. The next most compelling thing
is how easily external URLs link, like this:

# http://www.wcsb.org/
# ftp://ftp.redhat.com/
# news://news.mozilla.org/
# http://slashdot.org/
# http://theregister.co.uk/

Combined with one namespace and a simple markup, a Wiki exhibits many
of the characteristics of [WabiSabi|Help:WabiSabi].
