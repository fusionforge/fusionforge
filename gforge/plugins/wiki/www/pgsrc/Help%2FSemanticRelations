The PhpWiki:SemanticWeb implementation follows closely the
implementation of the semantic mediawiki extension. It features:

* Annotation of article-article-links by means of configurable relations (link-types).
* Annotation of articles with simple data-values that are assigned to numeric 
  attributes.
* Support for using physical units of measurement in all numerical attributes, 
  without need for prior configuration.

Relations can be searched for with regular experssions, attributes can be 
searched for with full mathematical expressions.

The annotation data will be combined with annotations from the current
category system to generate standard-compliant OWL/RDF output, which
can be fully processed with tools that support OWL DL or OWL Lite,
but which can also be treated in a meaningful way by software that
supports RDF, RDFS or XML.

== Relations

Relations (link-types) are defined as link with the following syntax:
<verbatim>
  relation::pagename
</verbatim>

== Attributes

Attributes are defined as link to numbers (understandable by 
[GNU Units|http://www.gnu.org/software/units/units.html]) with 
the following markup syntax:
 
<verbatim>
  attribute:=value
</verbatim>

Attributes and relations refer only to the current page - the current
page is the subject, the relation the predicate, the linked page the
object in a RDF triple. Relations always refer to another page,
attributes not.

== Example

<em>Sample taken from http://wiki.ontoworld.org/index.php/San_Diego</em>

<verbatim>
San Diego [is_a::city] located in the southwestern corner of
[California|located_in::California], the extreme southwestern corner
of the [United States|country::United States]. It is the county seat
of San Diego County. As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of
[1,223,400|population:=1,223,400]; as of 2005, the California Department
of Finance estimated the city to have 1,305,736 residents. The city
is the second-largest in California and the seventh-largest in the
United States and is noted for its temperate climate and many beaches.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total
area of [963.6 km²|area:=963.6 km^2] (372.0 mi²). 840.0 km² 
(324.3 mi²) of it is land and 123.5 km² (47.7 mi²) of it is water.
The total area is 12.82% water.

Most notably, San Diego is the location of the 2005 International
Symposium on Wikis 2005, and the San Diego Zoo, and the San Diego
Chargers.
