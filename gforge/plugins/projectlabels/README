Presentation
------------

This plugin has been written for Gforge 4.5.  It allows the site
administrator to define any number of "labels", and apply one of these
labels to projects.  The labels are identified by a name and contain a
chunk of text or HTML code.  That piece of text is then displayed next
in the overview pages of projects that are appropriately labeled.

The purpose is to visually highlight a few projects, such as a
"project of the month", on their overview pages.

Installation
------------

This is a valid Debian source package. You can use "fakeroot
debian/rules binary" or "debuild -us -uc" to generate a Debian
package.

If you're not using Debian, then please read debian/rules and work out
where the files need to be copied (it's very easy). :-)
