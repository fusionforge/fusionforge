The "sourceforge" package was first debianised on Wed, 22 Nov 2000
22:06:35 +0100 by Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>.  Work has been
constant since then, and the package evolved a great deal.  It began
to work, for a start, and then it evolved into GForge, what with the
more recent versions of the Sourceforge software having been made
proprietary.  And then in early 2009 it evolved into FusionForge, what
with the more recent versions of GForge having been rewritten as
proprietary software without a name change.
