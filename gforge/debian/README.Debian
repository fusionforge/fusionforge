Sourceforge for Debian
======================

Status
------

Want to know what the status of this package is?  Read
/usr/share/doc/sourceforge/TODO.Debian or (even better)
<http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group_id=259>.  If you miss a
feature, or find a bug, or want to help, don't hesitate to contact me
(Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>) .  Plenty of features are missing,
I'm working on some, but if you don't tell me which ones you miss the
most I might process them in the wrong order for you.

  Please read the bug reports on the Debian bug-tracking system (at
<URL:http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=sourceforge>)
before submitting new ones.  Be warned that bug reports describing a
problem precisely and/or offering a solution will probably be
processed faster :-)


Installation notes
------------------
  Sourceforge is a big piece of software.  It's far-reaching.  It
fiddles with many different parts of the system.  As automated as I
have tried to make its installation, there are still things that need
to be done by hand, maybe even by a system administrator.

  First, you'll need a hostname.  Get the sourceforge.<your-domain>
DNS name to be created, pointing on the IP address of the host you're
installing Sourceforge on.  The "sourceforge" part isn't required, you
can call it however you like.  However, I'll assume you chose
"sourceforge" from now on; substitute as needed.

  If you want to use the Apache virtual hosting service, you'll even
need a delegation of a subdomain.  Get your system administrator to
delegate you the SOA for the sourceforge.<your-domain> subdomain.
This will allow Sourceforge to create new hostnames for projects when
needed (foo.sourceforge.<your-domain>, for instance), as well as some
hostnames needed by the system (for mailing-lists or CVS, for
instance).  This is if you choose web_only to be false when
configuring Sourceforge.

  The LDAP server is hosted on the same host and automatically
managed, therefore you should not have to worry too much about it.
You might be able to access it from another host, but I'm not sure
you'll be able to modify the entries in it.  I would advise not to in
any case, since it would make the data contained in the LDAP directory
inconsistent with the real data stored in the PostgreSQL database.

  You'll need a configured MTA for Sourceforge.  Depending on whether
the Sourceforge users are local or remote, you might need to set up a
smarthost or something else.  Sourceforge depends on a working mail
system, and you won't be able to create user accounts without it.  I'm
not sure yet what advanced tricks need to be done with the MTA.  There
might be some stuff to do with virtual domains for mailing-lists or
user email forwarding...  I haven't fully investigated it yet.  Your
contribution will be most welcome.

  Depending on the targeted audience, you might want to get a real
SSL/TLS certificate from some certification authority, whether it be a
professional one or your personal one (or the one in your company).
Otherwise, just use mod-ssl-makecert as advised during the
configuration phase, and get your own custom certificate.

  Do *not* delete the /etc/sourceforge/*.template files.  They are
needed.  Do not alter them either unless you *know* what you're doing.


Packaging roadmap
-----------------
  This section sketches a roadmap of the steps that needed to be taken
before any official release of Sourceforge in Debian was possible.

  It is completely outdated, and wrong.  I once followed this roadmap,
but it turned out that some things came before others and some came
after, I switched to SF 2.5, that sort of stuff.  The latest scheme
was 2.5-0+x (up to 2.5-0+15) before upload, 2.5-1 being the first
upload to Debian unstable.  Current scheme is a classical "2.5-x" for
released packages (the ones I upload to Debian).  Inter-release
versioning scheme, for the packages I use internally before uploading,
uses `+' (the current development package is 2.5-9+5).

  I keep the original roadmap only for reference, and it might just
get deleted altogether in the near future.  Here it comes:

,----
| I'll use a pre-release numbering scheme similar to Branden Robinson's,
| except I'll use more phases.
| 
| Phase 1 (package revisions 2.0-0phase1v1 to 2.0-0phase1v<$BIGNUM>)
| ------------------------------------------------------------------
| This phase will concentrate on the web services that only involve PHP
| and the database.  This includes account and project creation and
| management, the bug-tracking system, the task manager, the forums, the
| support manager, the user's page and the software map.  Probably also
| the patch manager and the news system, maybe the doc manager.
| 
|   These packages will probably break everything everytime you'll
| install them, so I won't even try to provide smooth upgrades.  Yet
| I'll provide an apt-get'able directory for the brave.
| 
| Phase 2 (2.0-0phase2v*)
| -----------------------
| This phase will get into the system a bit more and end by proposing
| features that require access to real files and services on the system:
| the end of phase2 will offer all the items marked "maybe" in phase1,
| plus the FTP and file releases services, as well as integration with
| the MTA.
| 
|   At this stage I'll try and stabilize the package a bit, so that from
| phase3 Sourceforge can be cleanly upgraded with a reasonably low risk
| of breakage.
| 
| Phase 3 (2.0-0phase3*)
| ----------------------
| This phase will take care of the services that require modifications
| to existing software (in particular, CVS and CVS-Web will have to be
| patched) or deep meddling with the system (DNS and web virtual
| hosting, Unix account creation with libnss-probably-mysql).  Mailing
| lists should be operational by the end of phase3 if not earlier.
| 
| Phase 4 (2.0-0phase4*)
| ----------------------
| That one should wrap it up before the big show, completing all the
| tidbits that were previously overlooked: the software foundries, the
| search engine, and basically everything I can think of that I forgot
| before.
| 
| Face it, I've got to get it out sometime
| ----------------------------------------
|   By that time, I should (hopefully) be a full-fledged Debian
| developer and I'll upload to unstable.  If I'm not yet, I'll call for
| some thick-skinned volunteer to sponsor me and upload it for me.  That
| could be called -0phase5, but it'll be high time to call it
| sourceforge-2.0-1.  And -2.0-2 and -2.0-3 and so on, 'cause I suspect
| there will be bugs.
| 
|   I'm not yet sure if the BTS can be used to track bugs on a package
| that's not in Debian yet, but if it can I will probably encourage its
| use even for very early packages, and take into consideration all the
| reports I find there.  The only exception will be for bug-reports
| telling me that the upstream codebase I'm packaging is out-of-date,
| see next paragraph.  These ones will get closed immediately (well, as
| soon as I see them anyway), with minimal comment, or merged with the
| first one that happened.
| 
|   I choose to package the Sourceforge released code (labeled 2.0 by
| the SF crew).  I know that the development version has since the 2.0
| release been made accessible by anonymous CVS.  I know that tremendous
| enhancements have been committed into this CVS, not the least of which
| are internationalisation and localisation.  I know that bugs have been
| fixed.  Yet I don't feel like packaging a big piece of intrusive
| software like Sourceforge while running after the backlog and tracking
| its evolution at the same time.  Don't be alarmed, I will eventually
| follow the upstream evolution, but only after the sourceforge-2.0-*
| has stabilised a bit and the bugs in the BTS are only (or mostly) bugs
| that have already been fixed upstream instead of problems coming from
| the packaging.
| 
|   Of course, I'll be interested in feedback from users.  I just love
| receiving email...  There are, however, some items of feedback I'd
| *NOT* be grateful for:
| 
| - aesthetic comments: except for the top banner that I did, the look
| and design of the site have been made by the SF crew upstream.  If it
| doesn't please you, there are several (currently two) themes.  If
| these themes do not please you, propose your own upstream.  If it
| makes it into upstream, it'll make it into the package.
| 
| - "not up-to-date" reminders.  See three paragraphs above.
| 
| - "speed up, you're late" comments.  You'll notice I deliberately did
| not state any date in this roadmap.  I have no clue how long it will
| take, what with the NM queue and real-life and stuff, and any date
| you'd get out of my mouth would be heavily smelling of alcohol (thus
| being void).  If you feel I'm late, help me.
| 
|   On the contrary, here are some examples of interaction and help I'd
| *very much* be interested in:
| 
| - security advice, with explanations (and patches if possible).  I am
| absolutely no security guru, and I suspect that there are many ways SF
| could be exploited.
| 
| - help with the BTS: I haven't focused really on all the evolutions of
| SF since the 2.0 release.  I expect many people will file reports for
| bugs that have already been fixed upstream.  Keeping the two BTS as
| synchronous as possible would be a big help.

Thanks
------
  Apart from the Sourceforge crew at VA Linux, who did (and still do)
a great job with SF, I'd like to send my thanks to Guillaume Morin,
who wrote a very thorough Sourceforge installation guide.  That guide
gives step-by-step instructions for the installation procedure, and a
big part of the packaging task was to turn these instructions into
automated scripts.

  Thanks also to all who tested packages and helped correct many
errors of mine.

  And mega-thanks to Christian Bayle.  That guy single-handedly
adapted and fixed all the scripts related to CVS, DNS, SSH accounts,
and probably more.
