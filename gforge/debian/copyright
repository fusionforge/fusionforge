This package was first debianised on Wed, 22 Nov 2000 22:06:35 +0100
by Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>.  Work has been constant since
then, and the package evolved a great deal.  It began to work, for a
start.

Then time passed, and Sourceforge was no longer distributed as Free
Software, so a fork happened.  The last known Free version of
Sourceforge was the starting point for Gforge.
