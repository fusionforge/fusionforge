The "sourceforge" package was first debianised on Wed, 22 Nov 2000
22:06:35 +0100 by Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>.  Work has been
constant since then, and the package evolved a great deal.  It began
to work, for a start, and then it evolved into GForge, what with the
more recent versions of the Sourceforge software having been made
proprietary.

GForge itself is Copyright © 2000-2008 by a fair number of people,
including:

Tim Perdue              <tim@gforge.org>

Christian Bayle         <gforge@free.fr>
