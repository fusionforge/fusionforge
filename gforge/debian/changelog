sourceforge (2.6-0+11) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Fixed theme registration for 2.6->2.6 upgrades.  You might
    encounter problems if you registered them manually, in this case
    simply run the following SQL in the sourceforge database:
    DELETE FROM themes WHERE dirname LIKE 'savannah_%'; BUG #124 CLOSED
  * [Christian] changed Layout.class with div align=center BUG #120 CLOSED
  * [Christian] removed link to docman BUG #122 CLOSED

sourceforge (2.6-0+10) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Christian] Corrected wrong link in menu.php for lastlogin.php.
  * [Roland] *Lots* of patches from Olafur Osvaldsson <oli@isnic.is>
    applied, many thanks to him.
  * [Roland] Changed about.php page so that it now speaks about Debian
    Sourceforge.  It's internationalised, too.
  * [Roland] Page footer is now shorter, internationalised, and pointing
    to the About page.
  * [Roland] Fixed links in the Site News page.
  * [Roland] Made groups siteadmin and newsadmin public to prevent
    problems with submitting of news.  Also, changed their names for
    coherence with names inherited from the 2.5 branch.
  * [Christian] Continuing work on theming, added a new function in
    html.php (url_html)
  * [Roland] Removed a few bashisms in maintainer scripts.
  * [Christian] Added savannah converted themes and appropriate db inserts
  * [Christian] Added README.Themes

sourceforge (2.6-0+9) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Christian] Added dependancy on rcs for our patched cvsweb
  * [Roland] Renamed db-upgrade26.pl to db-upgrade.pl.
  * [Roland] Split the parse_sql_file function out of db-upgrade.pl and
    into its own file (sqlparser.pm).
  * [Roland] Fixed configuration of apache-ssl.
  * [Roland] Worked to make the database scheme independent of the upgrade
    path: installing 2.6 over 2.5 now yields the same scheme as installing
    2.6 from scratch.  Well, actually, not quite, but the differences are
    only in a few constraints, and that'll be taken care of when we
    provide some way to backup and restore a database.
  * [Roland] db-upgrade.pl: replay the database "fixes" included in the
    2.5 packages before starting the conversion to 2.6, to permit upgrades
    from versions that are not the latest in the 2.5 series.
  * [Christian] gig2png conversion to make GNU happy.
  * [Christian] some html cleaning in Layout.class and osdn.php
  * [Christian] added Add, Delete, or Edit Themes in Site Utilities for admin
  * [Christian] change uid/gid attribution in ldap.php to be backend compliant
  * [Christian] added debian and savannah Themes
  * [Roland] Remove /cvsroot symlink on purge.
  * [Roland] Insert the appropriate rows in the database for themes.
  * [Roland] Added a "checkpoint" in db-upgrade.pl, so that we should now
    be able to provide upgrades between different releases in the 2.6
    series.
  * [Roland] Added a totally rewritten Korean language translation file
    provided by Soon-Son Kwon <kss@kldp.org>.  Many thanks to him.
  * [Roland] Also rewrote the French language translation file, so as to
    not be lagging behind the Koreans :-)
  * [Roland] Also fixed a few typoes in the English language.
  * [Christian] Removed confusing unused image from archive and put in unused
    directory in cvs, preparing easy Theming
  * [Christian] Theming should be easier though not complete

sourceforge (2.6-0+8) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Christian] Added debian/BUGS
  * [Christian] Corrected approve_pending bug
  * [Christian] Corrected wrong userid for CVS
  * [Christian] Fixed libmcryp4 dependancy
  * [Christian] Added anoncvs_ users in ldap db
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Added man page for sourceforge-config (from a
    Docbook SGML file).  This fixes a lintian error.
  * [Christian] Added ldap support for chrooted anonymous cvs
  * [Roland] Minor typo-fixes here and there, and a few cosmetic changes.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Fixed unix_box entries.
  * [Roland] Fixed leftover cruft in /etc/nsswitch.conf purging.
  * [Roland] Made the header somewhat customizable (display/hide the
    banner, mainly).
  * [Roland] Transitioned to PostgreSQL 7.2.  That was far from easy,
    since PG 7.2 is much more anal retentive than 7.1.3.  In particular,
    foreign key constraints and indices are not automagically dropped,
    which caused strange errors and deep frustration in the upgrade path
    from the 2.5 series.
  * [Roland] While I was fixing that, I also took the opportunity to add
    some code to drop the useless "deadXX" columns that are introduced by
    the 2.5->2.6 upgrade (ALTER TABLE/DROP COLUMN not being implemented in
    PostgreSQL yet).
  * [Roland] Moved a few SQL statements used only in the 2.5->2.6 upgrade
    from db-upgrade26.pl to sf2.5-to-sf2.6.sql.

  * [Christian] Changed to use cvsweb
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Added "-s /bin/sh" when su'ing to postgres.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Moved templates to a Policy-compliant location

sourceforge (2.6-0+6) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Added docs.
  * [Roland] Added libmime-base64-perl and libhtml-parser-perl to
    dependencies (db-upgrade26.pl now uses MIME::Base64 and
    HTML::Entities).
  * [Roland] Added migration capability to the db-upgrade26.pl script.
    Database upgrades smoothly from 2.5 to 2.6.  Hopefully.  Not very well
    tested yet.
  * [Christian] Removed libmcrypt bug workaround

  * [Roland] Fixed a few minor bugs in my/index.php.
  * [Roland] Fixed speling error in Description: field.
  * [Roland] Added dependencies on packages providing the vi editor.
  * [Roland] www/include/Layout.class (and others): Removed the VA logo in
    the site icon.  The new site icon now consists of a black "SF" written
    over a Debian swirl.
  * [Roland] deb-specific/install-ldap.sh: Test for the existence of
    /etc/ldap/slapd.conf before trying to modify it, and suggest to
    reconfigure slapd if it is not present.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Ported the new LDAP schema, that had been
    forgotten for some reason.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Fixed email addresses on the users' home page.
  * [Roland] Added the login name and real name of the user whose
    permissions in a project are being edited.
  * [Roland] Replaced a call to /etc/init.d/bind9 restart by a (more
    appropriate) reload.  Used the policy-defined invoke-rc.d, too.
  * [Roland] Fixed dependencies to correctly handle apache-ssl and
    exim-tls.

    account
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Rewrote the config file handling, so that it does
    not overwrite local changes.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Added cvssh.pl.

  * [Christian] Repared bad db init 

 -- Christian Bayle <bayle@aist.enst.fr>  Sat, 17 Nov 2001 01:29:25 +0100

sourceforge (2.6-0+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Started working on 2.6.  Don't expect it to work just yet.
  * Split the DB installation/deinstallation process out of
    postinst/postrm/prerm and into an install-db.sh script.  Made it a bit
    less verbose.
  * Split the Apache installation/deinstallation process out of
    postinst/prerm and into an install-db.sh script.
  * Cleaned the exim configuration a bit.
  * Cleaned the DNS configuration a bit.
  * Cleaned the install-*.sh scripts a lot.  They now all look the same,
    are more readable (well, they are more readable to me), and work
    approximately the same way.  Added a template for future such scripts
    (install-skel.sh).
  * [Christian] Put utils/include.pl utils/sql2ldif.pl
    utils/underworld-dummy/ssh_dump.pl of 2.5 as 2.6 scripts, sql2ldif
    will probably have to be re-seen
  * [Christian] Added sf-2.6-complete.sql script
  * [Christian] Cleaned debian/rules
  * [Christian] Added path in apache template
  * deb-specific/db-upgrade26.pl: Rewrote the SQL parsing state machine so
    that it 1. works better, 2. is more readable, 3. knows about comments,
    4. knows about COPY [...] FROM stdin.
  * [From 2.5 branch] Fixed install-cvs.sh so that it no longer inserts
    too many lines in the inetd.conf file.
  * [From 2.5 branch] Added sf_ldap_modify_if_exists() to
    www/include/ldap.php.  Works the same as sf_ldap_modify, but returns a
    non-error if the LDAP entry does not exist.  Patched
    sf_ldap_user_set_attribute to use this new function, so that even
    users with no account (or no account yet) can change their passwords
    and personal info.
  * Adapted the patch to display the site admin menu, from using the now
    deprecated function user_ismember() to using the new (2.6) methods
    involving Group and Permission objects.
  * [From 2.5 branch] Improved personal page: site admin(s) now see(s) a
    list of pending projects, and news admin(s) see(s) a list of pending
    news bytes.
  * Replaced calls to /etc/init.d/<script> <action> in maintainer scripts
    with invoke-rc.d <script> <action>, as per policy.
  * Slightly rewrote the template handling in postinst script, to allow
    parsing for files not in /etc/sourceforge (not needed yet, but it
    might come in handy).
  * Removed an unneeded dependency on bash (in install-chroot.sh).
  * Added resolution data.  Fixes the "Can't submit a bug/patch/whatever"
    bug.

sourceforge (2.5-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a PATH problem in install-ldap.sh.
  * Made the cronjobs silent.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Nov 2001 20:03:28 +0100

sourceforge (2.5-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed /etc/aliases entry for sourceforge user.  Really, this time.
  * Fixed Trove software map (closes: #108297).
  * Added sf-add-skill and sf-register-theme scripts.
  * Removed the need for chsh sourceforge in update-user-group-cvs.sh.
  * Fixed user list and group list.
  * [Christian] Added support for sites without DNS delegation.
  * Included patch from Olivier Garcia <olivier@linux-nerd.com>: support
    for multiple network cards.
  * Made sourceforge.config ash-compatible.
  * Fixed User.class (closes: #108682).
  * Added the alias for the Mailman images in sf-httpd.conf.template.
  * Fixed the most important entry in the zone file (ours).
  * Email forwarding should now work (through LDAP).  I'm afraid this has
    required that we depend on exim specifically (instead of any other
    MTA).  If you desperately need support for another MTA, please read
    (and understand) deb-specific/install-exim.sh and send me the
    appropriate install-<your-MTA-here>.sh for inclusion.
  * Fixed fill-in-the-blanks.pl to allow multiple replacements of the same
    token on the same line.  That was needed by some magic that's not here
    anymore, but it's better nevertheless.
  * [Christian] Added SF_robot and Replicator entry in sql2ldif script.
  * [Christian] Made ldap_add_password template var work.
  * Mailing-lists should now work.  The emails should also be sent to the
    list with the same LDAP trick we used for the email forwarding, and
    the web part of Mailman be correctly configured.
  * Fixed apache-ssl support (apache + libapache-mod-ssl was the only
    combination I had previously tested).
  * [Christian] Added ldap check in apache/php config.
  * [Christian] Ldap online support enabled.  Requires intensive testing
    and probably security enhancements similar to database.
  * Fixed possible infinite loop in cronjobs/calculate_user_metric.php.
  * [Christian] backport of 2_6_1 docman for better language support
  * [Christian] Fixed install-ldap loss of robot password
  * [Christian] Started FTP setup
  * [Christian] Download server added
  * [Christian] File Release FRS support added (closes: #108173)
  * [Christian] Added CVS nightly tarballs
  * Fixed errors in LDAP configuration so that the online creation of
    groups and users works.
  * Fixed a thinko in debian/sourceforge/cron.d.
  * Added a periodical check for the presence of an incoming directory in
    the users' home dir.
  * Fixed versioned dependency on debconf (thanks to lintian).
  * Removed unnecessary CVS/ dirs from the package when it's built from a
    CVS checkout (as opposed to a CVS export).
  * Fix in include.pl to allow the use of an empty password.  To be
    tested, but it might help closing #116009.
  * Delayed deletion of files until the very end of the uninstall process,
    in order to potentially help fixing one symptom described in #116009
    too.
  * deb-specific/install-exim.sh: (still related to, and not closing,
    #116009) no need to require /etc/sourceforge/local.pl when
    deconfiguring.
  * Updated debian/TODO a bit.
  * Added fileforge.pl, a setuid Perl script to move files around securely
    (without needing to grant www-data read/write permission on
    $user/incoming/ directories).
  * [Christian] Splited install-dns.sh in install-dns.sh and
    install-cvs.sh and related modification in prerm and postinst, purge
    is now done for cvs, but i don't use update-inetd that doesn't restore
    old config.  probably cvs maintainer should be contacted to have a
    friendly sourceforge config, because cvs config break sourceforge cvs
    config
  * Migrated install-cvs.sh to update-inetd (using appropriate
    --comment-chars tricks).
  * Fixed top of page background (looked nice on Forged Metal theme, but
    not with any other theme).
  * Deduped releases in the Quick Release System.
  * Fixed searches: broken SQL syntax in the admin-only search, and
    removed case-sensitiveness in the other search.
  * www/include/theme.php: Fixed SQL (removed quotes from integer fields).
  * www/include/theme.php: Changed the default user theme to a saner one.
  * www/include/cache.php: Removed warning when the page is not cached.
  * debian/sourceforge.prerm: Fixed uninstall-time bugs (deluser could
    fail, and the FTP root directory could be non-empty).
  * debian/sourceforge.config: Eventually fixed the empty db_passwd bug
    (closes: #116009).
  * Removed the web-only installation.  All the services work, and there
    is no need for a stripped-down version (which would be full of broken
    links and non-working features).
  * debian/control: Replaced Recommends: with Depends: now that the
    web-only installation is no more.  Removed cvsweb, too, since we
    provide our own version.
  * deb-specific/database.inc.template, deb-specific/local.inc.template,
    deb-specific/sf-httpd.secrets.template: Took the LDAP password out of
    the reach of unallowed users (same trick we used for the database
    password).
  * deb-specific/install-ldap.sh: Rewrote the way the LDAP password was
    handled.
  * Added a debconf note concerning the way libpam-ldap has to be
    configured.
  * [Christian] deb-specific/install-ldap.sh: Fixed incorrect upgrade.
  * Plus a ton of other fixes and cleanups, but this changelog entry is
    already long enough.
  * Today, the 1st of November 2001, I'd like to dedicate this release to
    Édith and Virginie.  So there.

sourceforge (2.5-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * I am starting to get rather confident in this package, to the point
    where I cannot think of major bugs preventing it to enter woody
    (closes: #99336).  It will still have to wait for its dependencies to
    be fulfilled and for its other RC bugs to be fixed/closed, but I won't
    artificially keep it out from testing.
  * Fixed possible double insertion of the sourceforge alias in
    /etc/aliases. 
  * Check the presence of, and when needed, add, "extension={pgsql,gd}"
    lines in /etc/php4/{apache,cgi}/php.ini files (closes: #107290).
  * Moved some code where it belongs (in the "if web_only = false"
    if-block) in sourceforge.config.
  * Added a Debconf note to remind the admin to create the SSL/TLS
    certificate.
  * A few cosmetic changes.
  * Added an "Installation notes" paragraph in README.Debian.
  * Removed an entry in the TODO file (now it's a bug on the BTS).
  * Fixed the diary stuff (viewing entries, monitoring other people's
    diary) (closes: #108166, #108169).

  * Added more checks into the postinst to deal with more possible errors.
  * Small fixes in postinst and postrm.
  * Changed the way we use the templates (fill-in-the-blanks.pl) and keep
    the postinst script -e (closes: #103902).
  * Continued work on db-upgrade.pl: added a function to parse SQL files.
    The first installation (database initialisation) is now done via this
    script too.
  * Redirected email to sourceforge@domain to the server admin address (as
    specified by the debconf question).
  * Continued the hunt for references to sourceforge.net, including
    removed links to some pages that were too deeply connected with
    sf.net.

sourceforge (2.5-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed references to foundries from the site homepage.
  * Went through debian/TODO.  Didn't do much, but the file is a bit
    cleaner and more up-to-date now.  Transferred a bit of it onto
    Savannah.
  * Added French translation into the debconf template.
  * Ask confirmation for passwords in debconf.
  * Other minor tweaks in debconf.
  * Fixed cvsweb "Unable to find gzip binary in $PATH" bug.
  * Fixed the PostgreSQL reconfiguration in case the server changes IP
    addresses.

  * [Christian] Remove warning from grap.c compilation (Dirty code) 
  * [Christian] Started to reintroduce in local.inc.template things about
    ldap 
  * [Christian] Modified dirs for ftp (things changing have to be in var
    not in usr, remember that a system should work with /usr /etc read
    only, that's why zone files for bind are in var) 
  * Trimmed package dependencies a bit.
  * Improved the way postinst detects an error upon database and user
    creation.
  * Added sfdocs.sql, not (yet) used.
  * [Christian] Fixed incorrect list of shell in account.php (function

sourceforge (2.5-0+17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a postinst bug.
  * Merged stuff from Christian again:
    + Moved db_get sourceforge/noreply_to_bitbucket because later db_get
      locks 
    + Created install-ssh.sh and relativ modifs in prerm and postinst
    + Modified local.pl.template to have database access
    + Adding ldap config that allow user/passwd management without
      touching /etc files. LDAP is not directly used from php like it's done
      on current CVS snapshot.
    + By default now ssh don't chroot (Possible, thanks to ldap) and there
      is a symlink /cvsroot to let CVS with ssh run like before and there is
      an option chroot to install-ssh.sh to have chroot again. To have a on
      demand per user chroot, we maybe should create a special shell that to
      this. Because we run in one box cvs imply ssh, this make that a cvs
      writer has got a shell on your box. Chroot restrict access, it would
      also be possible to restrict access using cvssh (alias grap.c) without
      chroot
    + Modified update-user-group-cvs.sh to update ldap tables
    + Correct a mistake in /cvs/ page (Added :ext: at cvs command) 
    + Added cvssh in /bin/
    + Changed sql2lif.pl to have cvssh as default shell in ldap tables
  * Stripped cvssh to make lintian happy.

    + Added vhost_alias_module check in sourceforge.postinst
    + Work on sql2ldif.pl and install-ldap.sh 
  * Fixed crontab so that it doesn't complain when the package is
    uninstalled.
  * Also in crontab: do not start the non-web-only scripts if the
    installation was web-only.
  * Depend on mail-transport-agent.

sourceforge (2.5-0+14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified sourceforge.config to get a correct ldap DN
  * Changed ldaptest for install-ldap.sh in deb-specific

  * Now nstall-ldap.sh is a working loader of the ldap database
  * Probably libnss-ldap will require modif of /etc/nsswitch.conf

  * This should help for apache aliasing of sites except if there is a
    solution without restarting apache

sourceforge (2.5-0+13.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Starting to merge in a huge lot of things that were previously in the
    TODO list, done by Christian Bayle <bayle@aist.enst.fr>.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Wed,  2 May 2001 23:08:30 +0200

sourceforge (2.5-0+13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Should fix the error on news forum creation (thanks to Y. J. Chun
    <monac@pmail.net>).
  * Added a $sys_images_url (Y. J. Chun again).
  * Started work on the LDAP stuff.  The script seems to work, now I don't
    know what to do with it yet.
  * Run the postinst psql scripts as sourceforge to satisfy PostgreSQL's
    paranoia.
  * Sort-of-fixed a problem occurring when trying to see the source for

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Wed,  2 May 2001 19:29:23 +0200

sourceforge (2.5-0+12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed some incorrect SQL (DROP TABLE IF EXISTS), removed the adequate
    hack in some cronjobs.
  * Added project metrics cronjobs.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Apr 2001 18:50:43 +0200

sourceforge (2.5-0+11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ran lintian.  Fixed errors and warnings (many).

sourceforge (2.5-0+8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Small patch: default timezone is read from /etc/timezone.  Yeah, very
    small patch indeed :-)

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Apr 2001 19:59:04 +0200

sourceforge (2.5-0+7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the database host to localhost in psql calls from the
    maintainer scripts.  It still doesn't work with out-of-the-box
    PostgreSQL installation (which is a little paranoid), but it should
    lower the requirements for manual intervention.
  * Un-commented the Apache restart in maintainer scripts.  It's really
    needed, especially for the prerm.
  * Cease to drop the databases on remove (only do this un purge).

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Apr 2001 20:27:27 +0200

    fixed some SQL in the user rating script.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Feb 2001 23:03:36 +0100

sourceforge (2.5-0+3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Started work on the cron jobs.  Same again, don't expect it to Just
    Work, because it won't.  Why on Earth they should write cron jobs in
    PHP I will probably never understand.
  * CHanged Depends: perl5 to Depends: perl.
