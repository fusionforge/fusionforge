Description: Integrated development project framework
 This package provides many services a development project can use,
 such as bug-tracking, task management, mailing-lists, CVS repository,
 forums, support request helper, webpage / FTP hosting, release
 management, etc.  All these services are integrated into one web site.
 They are managed via a nice web interface.
