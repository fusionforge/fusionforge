-Ldap empty leaves some sourceforge stuff in ldap db (Workaround:
/usr/lib/sourceforge/install-ldap.sh reset)

-We don't check that mcrypt module is loaded in php4.ini (Workaround
do-it-yourself :-)

-libmcrypt4 former to 2.4.22-2 require libmcrypt-dev (I should fix
dependency)

-upgrade from 2.5 miss some tables (On the way to be done)

-QRS is broken (Doesn't upload)
