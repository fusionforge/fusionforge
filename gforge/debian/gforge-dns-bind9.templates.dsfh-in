_Description: Do you want mail to ${noreply} to be deleted?
 Gforge sends plenty of e-mail from the "${noreply}" address,
 and maybe even some e-mail to that address too.
 .
 It is advised that you let the package direct e-mail to that address to a
 black hole (/dev/null), unless you have another use for that address.

 .
 Please note you will not be able to start Apache if you have no
 such certificate.

Template: gforge/shared/pam_ldap_config
Type: note
_Description: Gforge requires appropriate PAM-LDAP configuration
 Gforge requires the libpam-ldap package to be configured
 appropriately.  You might need to "dpkg-reconfigure libpam-ldap" in
 order to fix incorrect parameters.
 .
 Known good values are: LDAP protocol version=3, make root database
 admin=yes, root login account="cn=admin,dc=<your-dc-here>", crypt to
 use for passwords=crypt.  Make sure that you type the same password
 for the libpam-ldap root password and the Gforge LDAP password.

Template: gforge/shared/simple_dns
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Do you want a simple DNS setup?
 You can have a simple DNS setup wich uses wildcards to map all
 project web-hosts to a single IP, and direct all the scm-hosts
 to a single SCM server, or a complex setup wich allows you to
 have many servers as project web servers or SCM servers.
 .
 Even though you have a simple DNS setup, you can still have
 separate boxes for your project servers, it just assumes you
 have all the project web dirs on the same server and a single
 server for SCM.

Template: gforge/shared/replace_file_remove
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Do you want ${file} to be updated?
 In order for Gforge to be fully deinstalled, some changes must
 be made to the ${file} file.
 .
 Installer can either do them for you (and backup the current version in
 ${file}.gforge-old), or write the changes to another file
 (${file}.gforge-new) and let you propagate the changes to
 ${file} yourself.

Template: gforge/shared/file_changed
Type: note
_Description: Please check ${file}
 You have chosen not to let the Gforge package update the
 ${file} file.  Very well, Installer has not changed it.  Instead,
 It has written the suggested changes into ${file}.gforge-new.
 Please check this file and apply the appropriate changes
 to ${file}.
