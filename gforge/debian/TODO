This is a TODO list for the packaging.  Some items that used to be
here have been transferred onto the Savannah project, at
<http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group_id=259>.

* [CB] Make /stats/ work.  [RM] It seems the tables don't get filled
  up, so I'd be tempted to blame the cronjobs.

* [CB] Add documentation pointed in project admin page.  [RM] Has to
  wait for smooth DB upgrade.  [RM] Even though, most of the
  documentation is VA-centric and should not be used as is.

* [CB] ViewCVS instead of CVSWEB?

* [CB] Find how to use libnss-lwres.  [RM] ???

* [CB] Repair /admin/useredit.php.  [RM] Works for me.

* [CB] Repair /admin/editpackages.php (Create FTP_INCOMING in
  /var/lib/sourceforge/ftp)  [RM] Is this still current?

* [CB] language_code is missing in language table.  [RM] Probably a
  matter of data.  Has to wait for smooth DB upgrade.

* [RM] Decide on whether to use a chroot or not.
