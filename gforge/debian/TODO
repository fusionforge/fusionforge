This is a TODO list for the packaging.  Some items that used to be
here have been transferred onto the Savannah project, at
<http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group_id=259>.

* [CB] Make /stats/ work.  [RM] It seems the tables don't get filled
  up, so I'd be tempted to blame the cronjobs.

* [CB] Add documentation pointed in project admin page.  [RM] Has to
  wait for smooth DB upgrade.  [RM] Even though, most of the
  documentation is VA-centric and should not be used as is.

* [CB] ViewCVS instead of CVSWEB?  [RM] Chora might be even better,
  since it's in PHP and could be more easily hacked to include
  permission checking.

* [CB] When a project is private, cvsweb access should be too, this means
  implementing access control a la sourceforge in perl for CVSWEB or python 
  for ViewCVS. At the occasion give the sourceforge look to CVS Browsing.

* [CB] Find how to use libnss-lwres.  [RM] ??? [CB] It is not doing what I 
  was thinking. It may be possible to make the dns server to use directly
  postgres-db or ldap (Look at sdb driver /usr/share/doc/bind9-doc/misc/sdb.gz )

* [CB] language_code is missing in language table.  [RM] Probably a
  matter of data.  Has to wait for smooth DB upgrade. [CB] Will be added in 2.6

* [RM] Decide on whether to use a chroot or not.

* [RM] Provide a way to un-release a file, and (why not?) to modify a
  released file afterwards.  Maybe.  [RM] Already supposed to work
  (edit releases), needs testing.

* [RM] Browse through everything and find out things to add here.

* [RM] Get the Unix status to be updated (as seems to be the normal
  case, cf. footnote 2 in /admin/useredit.php).
