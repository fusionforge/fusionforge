        - Foundry code now present and cleaned up.
          You can create new foundries simply by selecting that option in 
          the /admin/groupedit.php page (Tim)

        - Theming support sitewide and html library cleanup. Sample themes 
          included in /www/themes/ (Geoff)

        - Audit trail for projects. Now when site-admins and project-admins 
          change a project, certain events will cause an audit trail recording 
          (events like adding/removing users, updating permissions, etc) (Tim)

        - File release system totally rewritten from the ground up to use a 
          more normalized database schema. There is an upgrade script in 
          /www/admin/ which should help you migrate data from the old 
          structure (Tim)

        - Using some classes to "objectize" things like Groups, Projects, 
          and Foundries. Project and Foundry extend Group. See 
          /include/Group.class /include/Foundry.class and 
          /include/Project.class (Tim)

        - Hundreds of misc. interface cleanups sitewide. More user feedback, 
          ordering of pop-up list boxes, submit buttons added to the tops of 
          many forms sitewide, etc etc (Tim, Geoff, Wallace Lee)

        - Task manager can now move tasks among subprojects. (Wallace Lee)

        - Sitewide stats project. Organizing daily stats for each project 
          into summary tables, graphing the results. (Matt Snelham)

        - Groundwork for advogato-like system of peer ratings. Need to 
          finish user interface. New system goes beyond advogato, as each 
          user has a unique "importance factor" and overall ranking among 
          all users on the entire site. Only users that have achieved a 
          "trust" level will be able to successfully rate others. See 
          /www/admin/calculate_user_metric.php (Tim)

        - Changed user home pages to /users/*user_name*/ using .htaccess 
          directive similar to /foundry/ and /project/ (Tim)

1.5.0 

        - To get help setting up your copy of SourceForge,           
          visit the "SF Offsite Talk" discussion boards at
          http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=21304

        - Added a "portability" patch. Massive thanks to 
          William Hardeman and David HM Spector for this. SF deployers 
          everywhere will thank them

        - Removed a lot of hard-coded references to SF.net everywhere, 
          including hard-coded user_id's of the SF core staff

        - Wallace Lee continues to make numerous clean patches throughout 
          the site (naming forums/subprojects/mailing lists among others)

        - Optimizations throughout the code base - added intelligence to the
          user.php and group.php library so database queries aren't wasted. 

        - Tested under PHP4 and only one know issue was found and fixed.

        - Starting the process of database portability. Changed the keyword 
          "public" in groups to "is_public". Changing the "user" table to 
          "users" is next in line, but it is a HUGE task.

        - Tested some features on Postgres and found that LIMIT/OFFSET 
          syntax is incompatible. Postgres also cannot yet handle large 
          text fields that are > 8K in length (problem for the patch Mgr)

        - Slick new "browse" options on the bug/task/support/project mgrs

        - Changed project homepages to "/projects/*project_name*/" using 
          the .htaccess "files" directive. This is known to be problematic 
          on some other platforms.

        - Laid groundwork for "portals" which are half-baked and considered 
          useless right now.

        - Project Admin page modernized
