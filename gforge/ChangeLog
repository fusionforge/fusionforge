        * admin/approve_pending.php: Added LDAP support. For this,
        update each group individually instead of in mass. Also, some
        UI tweaks: now it's possible to approve projects individually,
        fields are shown somewhat cleaner. Since data now doubled
        between SQL and LDAP, steps to detect inconsistencies are
        performed with (hopefully) proper diagnostics (including
        preserving LDAP error descriptions in status_comment of
        group) and rudimentary auto-repair.

        * include/Error.class: Allow error messages to accumulate.

        * include/Group.class: addUser() and removeUser() LDAPized.

        * admin/groupedit.php: LDAPized.

			  if create/update successful.

	* include/menu.php: Make docs link bold.
	* account/first.php: Make docs link bold.

	mod_php died on including the directory instead of
	language class. Bad behaviour, almost as segfault of
	C app. Fixed.

	* Russian.class: File submitted by me was magically
        converted to windows-1251 encoding. Turn back to
        iso-8859-5.
