	* include/User.class: getUnixStatus() added.

        * admin/approve_pending.php: Added LDAP support. For this,
        update each group individually instead of in mass. Also, some
        UI tweaks: now it's possible to approve projects individually,
        fields are shown somewhat cleaner. Since data now doubled
        between SQL and LDAP, steps to detect inconsistencies are
        performed with (hopefully) proper diagnostics (including
        preserving LDAP error descriptions in status_comment of
        group) and rudimentary auto-repair.

        * include/Error.class: Allow error messages to accumulate.

        * include/Group.class: addUser() and removeUser() LDAPized.
