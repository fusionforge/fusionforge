	in local.inc, defaulted to UNIX
	ldpa.php is removed, the code was moved in LDAP.class
	sys_use_ldap will be removed shortly and replace by the 
	use of sys_account_manager_type=LDAP
	Side effect will be the possibility to implement easily your 
	own system account manager do deal, e.g. with your company NIS,or 
	already existing user accounts.
	The default behaviour stays the same.
	I also added sys_state columns with db/20040507.sql
	This is not yet used but will allow faster user creation
	sys_state will have 5 possible values
	R=request system account creation
	S=request system account suppression
	C=system account created
	D=system account deleted
	E=system account creation error
	F=system account deletion error
	N=no request

	hte *.tab files has been split into itself (for the message) and
	my/no_monitored_*_details (for the explanation).

	 have had downloads then they are visible under top
	 download in feature boxes. you still cant actually view

	 display public projects.

        between SQL and LDAP, steps to detect inconsistencies are
        performed with (hopefully) proper diagnostics (including
        preserving LDAP error descriptions in status_comment of
        group) and rudimentary auto-repair.

        * include/Error.class: Allow error messages to accumulate.

        converted to windows-1251 encoding. Turn back to
