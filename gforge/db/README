Some explanations:

-rw-rw-r--    1   276333 2002-12-24 16:43 gforge3.sql
The gforge3 sql initialisation file

-rw-rw-r--    1      292 2003-01-04 00:41 20021124-1_drop_foundry.sql
This foundry related files
This is not done in debian package since we would like to find a way to migrate this data
An idea is to convert foundry in project and to attach project that where part of a foundry 
in a subcategory of a newly created foundry category.

-rw-rw-r--    1     1675 2003-01-04 01:15 20021124-2_theming.sql
This will drop all theme formaly defined
This is not done in debian package since we consider that some user would like to keep theme default
choosen by user in previous sourceforge package.


-rw-rw-r--    1     5273 2003-01-04 01:08 20021124-3_gforge-debian-sf-sync.sql
This file contains update that were already done in debian package.
So gforge3 + 20021124-3_gforge-debian-sf-sync.sql should be equivalent to debian-sf 2.6 package

The previous files are update applied during gforge development, this file are used
in common by custom install and debian package install
20021213_doc_data-migrate.php has a perl equivalent in debian upgrade.

drwxrwsr-x    3     4096 2002-12-31 19:28 SQL_2.5

drwxrwsr-x    3     4096 2002-12-31 19:51 SQL_2.6

drwxrwsr-x    3     4096 2002-12-31 19:21 SQL_migrate-2.5-to-2.6
Old sql and others file to migrate from sourceforge 2.5 to 2.6

P.S.:
In debian upgrade is done with a perl script: deb-specific/db-upgrade.pl.
This script in debian does smooth upgrade from sourceforge 2.5 to 2.6 and to gforge.
This should be usable on a non debian install, and it contains valuable information if 
you wish to migrate from an old sourceforge 2.5 install.
