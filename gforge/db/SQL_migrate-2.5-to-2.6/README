Apologies in advance for the difficulty in converting from 2.5 to 2.6.

As always, SourceForge is undergoing radical changes, rewrites, feature 
and scalability enhancements. This means a large number of SQL and 
database changes need to occur in sequence over time.

The 2.5 codebase was a radical change because it moved from MySQL to PostgreSQL.
2.6 is radical because it takes full advantage of Postgres' advanced features 
and MySQL is no longer usable as it was for 2.5

The process of upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6 involves running these clearly dated 
sql diff files IN ORDER.

If you encounter difficulties, please report them in the SF Offsite Discussion board:
https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=21304

Please do not submit bugs to SourceForge.net.
