// Really Important Safety Tip: --> DO NOT LEAVE ANY WHITE
// SPACE AFTER THE CLOSING PHP TAG AT THE END OF THIS FILE!
//
// Doing so will really confuse the software and cause
// 1) cookies to fail and 2) HTML page headers to fail
// which will give you some preally hard-to-debug problems.
// Why? PHP is a *pre-processor* -- anything that's not PHP gets
// emitted as part of the HTML stream and processed by the browser,
// so white space is meaningful!

// FusionForge global paths

//TODO : check if these should be enabled by default ?

// FusionForge hostnames
//
// Hostnames should be fully qualified domain names (FQDNs); using short names
// would be prettier but would stop you from distributing your implementation
// across multiple domains.
//
// Of course, if you have a lot of machines serving a particular purpose
// such as FTP or for shell accounts, the "hostname" here might be in
// reality an addr_list of machines that is serviced by a round-robin
// mechanism or something fancy like a local-director.
//
// The default FusionForge domain
// this is used where ever the "naked" form of the FusionForge domain
// might be used.  E.g., "mailto:admin@gforge.net"
