// Really Important Safety Tip: --> DO NOT LEAVE ANY WHITE
// SPACE AFTER THE CLOSING PHP TAG AT THE END OF THIS FILE!
//
// Doing so will really confuse the software and cause
// 1) cookies to fail and 2) HTML page headers to fail
// which will give you some preally hard-to-debug problems.
// Why? PHP is a *pre-processor* -- anything that's not PHP gets
// emitted as part of the HTML stream and processed by the browser,
// so white space is meaningful!
//
//
// GForge hostnames
//
// Hostnames should be fully qualified domain names (FQDNs); using short names
// would be prettier but would stop you from distributing your SourceForge
// implementation across multiple domains.
//
// Of course, if you have a lot of machines serving a particular purpose
// such as FTP or for shell accounts, the "hostname" here might be in
// reality an addr_list of machines that is serviced by a round-robin
// mechanism or something fancy like a local-director.
//
// The default GForge domain
// this is used where ever the "naked" form of the GForge domain
// might be used.  E.g., "mailto:admin@gforge.net"
$sys_default_domain = '{domain_name}';
//$sys_fallback_domain = 'gforge2.company.com';
//$sys_internal_network = '192.168.1.';

// Machine used for downloading sources/packages
$sys_download_host = '{download_host}';

// Machine used for uploading sources/packages
$sys_upload_host = '{upload_host}';

// Machine(s) that host users' shell accounts
//  N.B. to the SourceForge Crew: What's the difference between the user
// host and the shell host?  They are clearly two different hostnames
// in the source code, but they seem to serve the same purpose..?
$sys_shell_host = '{shell_host}';
$sys_users_host = '{users_host}';

// Machine that hosts docs (such as the FAQs and the various software
// licenses (*BSD, [L]GPL, etc.).  You REALLY want this to be the same
// machine that the GForge code is running on because all of the
// PHP makes reference to these documents in terms of relative paths that
// are part of the GForge code tree.
$sys_docs_host = '{docs_host}';

// Machine that hosts the GForge mailing lists (This could also be
// the mail host if you have enough horsepower & bandwidth)
$sys_lists_host = '{lists_host}';

// Domain Name Servers
//    N.B.: Use terminated FQDNs here (with the final ".") so the resolver
//    doesn't attempt to recurse in the case of a slightly broken DNS
//    configuration
