/* grap is a wrapper designed to verify commands before passing them to system()
   or just reporting the accepted command.  grap will report an error if the
   input is invalid.  It checks for string lengths (prevent overflows),
   specific sets of options and commands.
   
   grap, in full force, is called as:  <grap> <option> "<command> <arguments
   list ... >" Where <grap> is this program, <option> is an optional trap
   for a single option (like "-e" or "-c" used by programs that call shells,
   subject to the approval list below), <command> is the command wished to
   be run (subject to the approval list below), and <arguments list .. > is
   the list of args passed to <command>.  All are optional, allowing for
   forms such as:
   	graplite -e "foo"   graplite "foo bar"  graplite -e "foo -c foo -f bar"
   	<g     ><o ><cmd>   <g     > <cmd/args> <g     ><o> <cmd/  args       >
   	
	<options> and <command> need to be exact matched to those in the
	acceptance list.  
*/

/* Define the locations of <option> <command> and <arguements list .. >
   on the command line.  0 is this program, begin at 1.  Note that 
   ARGS_ARGC takes everything FROM that position to the end of the
   arguments.

   Undefine any of these to not use them.
