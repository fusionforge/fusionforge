Installation of GForge has been made much easier than the old SF2.x codebase.
A great deal of unnecessary code and scalability hacks have been removed to 
make the installation and use of GForge practical for just about any 
Linux admin.

Even at that, it could be a daunting process for the uniniated. If you need

BASICS OF INSTALLATION
----------------------

You will need: 
	PostgreSQL 7.1 or higher ( http://postgresql.org/ )
	PHP 4.x or higher ( http://www.php.net/ )
	Apache 1.2x or higher ( http://www.apache.org/ )

	Optional Mailing list support:
	GNU MailMan ( http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/ )
	Python ( http://www.python.org/ )

	Optional Jabber Support:
	Jabberd ( http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/ )

Compile and install PostgreSQL, then PHP/Apache as per the instructions. PHP should 
be compiled into Apache, as well as compiled as a separate CGI. When compiling PHP, 
don't forget the --with-pgsql option for PostgreSQL support

Install Python and MailMan as per the instructions.


Database Setup
--------------

Create a blank database for postgres

# createdb alexandria

Be certain that plpgsql.so is present in your Postgres library path

Import the SourceForge Database

# psql alexandria < db/gforge3.sql

Web Setup
---------

Move the GForge tarball into position and make the www/ directory 
the "Document Root".

Apache's http.conf file should have these values:

php_value include_path ".:/path/to/:/path/to/www/include/"
<Location /projects>
  ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Location>
<Location /users>
  ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Location>

SF Config File
--------------

In the GForge distribution, you will find etc/local.inc. Move it to /etc/local.inc 
and edit all of the settings.

Giving the first user "Site Admin" privileges. Register a new user, and confirm 
it via the email link. Then enter the postgres command line and issue these 
commands:

insert into user_group (user_id,group_id) values (*****YOUR NEW ID*****,1);
update user_group set admin_flags='A' where group_id=1 
	AND user_id='*****YOUR NEW ID*****';

/etc/aliases - add this line and run "newaliases"
noreply:        /dev/null

STATS
-----

Setting up stats is a truly complex endeavor, and is not being tackled just yet.
However, you can look in the cron/ directory to look at the various processes 
involved and attempt to set it up yourself.
