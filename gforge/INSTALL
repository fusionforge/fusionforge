Installation of GForge has been made much easier than the old SF2.x codebase.
A great deal of unnecessary code and scalability hacks have been removed to 
make the installation and use of GForge practical for just about any 
Linux admin.

Even at that, it could be a daunting process for the uniniated. If you need

BASICS OF INSTALLATION
----------------------

You will need: 
	PostgreSQL 7.1 or higher ( http://postgresql.org/ )
	PHP 4.x or higher ( http://www.php.net/ )
	Apache 1.2x or higher ( http://www.apache.org/ )

	Optional Mailing list support:
	GNU MailMan ( http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/ )
	Python ( http://www.python.org/ )

	Optional Jabber Support:
	Jabberd ( http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/ )

Compile and install PostgreSQL, then PHP/Apache as per the instructions. PHP should 
be compiled into Apache, as well as compiled as a separate CGI. When compiling PHP, 
don't forget the --with-pgsql option for PostgreSQL support

Install Python and MailMan as per the instructions.


Database Setup
--------------

Create a blank database for postgres

# createdb alexandria

Be certain that plpgsql.so is present in your Postgres library path

Import the SourceForge Database

# psql alexandria < db/gforge3.sql

WEB SETUP
---------

Move the GForge tarball into position and make the www/ directory 
the "Document Root".

Apache's http.conf file should have these values:

ErrorDocument 404 /404.php
php_value include_path ".:/path/to/gforge/:/path/to/gforge/www/include/"
<Location /projects>
  ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Location>
<Location /users>
  ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Location>

PHP setup
---------

Your php.ini file should have "register_globals" set to on, as well 
as file uploads.

You may also add the include_path to the php.ini, as it will be 
necessary for your php cgi to run the cron jobs.

It is also recommended, for fastest possible performance, that you 
use a php caching accelerator, such as the Ion Cube Accelerator.

In addition, in your php.ini file, you may wish to set 
output_handler = ob_gzhandler 

FRS - File Release System
-------------------------

FRS has been radically simplified. Simply create a directory and 
make it owned by the webserver-user. Usually "chown -R nobody:nobody mydir" 
will do the trick.

This directory will be referenced in the SF Config File as $sys_upload_dir

SF Config File
--------------

In the GForge distribution, you will find etc/local.inc. Move it to /etc/gforge/local.inc 
and edit all of the settings.

Giving the first user "Site Admin" privileges. Register a new user, and confirm 
it via the email link. Then enter the postgres command line and issue these 
commands:

insert into user_group (user_id,group_id) values (*****YOUR NEW ID*****,1);
update user_group set admin_flags='A' where group_id=1 
	AND user_id='*****YOUR NEW ID*****';

The following entry primes the pump for user-ratings:
insert into user_metric0 values (1,'*****YOUR NEW ID*****',1,5,5,5,100,5);

/etc/aliases - add this line and run "newaliases"
noreply:        /dev/null

CRON JOBS
---------

Cron jobs are in the cronjobs/ directory and the README file contains a 
sample crontab. This gives you the basic cronjobs for updating certain 
statistics and data on the site.

More advanced cron jobs are being re-written to create the user email 
aliases, mailing lists, Unix groups/passwords, etc. Many of these 
scripts are available in the util/ directory, although they will not 
yet run without some polishing. If you polish up and make all these 
scripts work, please submit them back for inclusion at
