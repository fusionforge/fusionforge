Hello
for those of you who used sourceforge and now use gforge with the same database,
you probably noticed that if the language of the site was something other then
english the strings stored in the db are now not displayed correctly because
of the new coding mechanism used by gforge which is UTF-8. Here is how you can
transform the encoding of your database to make it work. That exemple will work
if your site used only one type of language for exemple latin1.

If you want to convert your db so that the strings will be displayed correctly,
do that:
1) dump your existing db
2) Create a new db with UTF-8 encoding:
createdb -E UNICODE your_new_db_name
3) Convert your dump with iconv (in that exemple, all strings were
in iso-8859-1):
iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 your_database_dump > database_dump_converted
4) Load your dump into the db using:
psql -d your_new_db_name -f database_dump_converted

And that's it.

Greetings
Phil
