DESC: This document describes the process used to transition a working
      SourceForge 2.5 installation to GForge 3.1 using the available Debian 
      packages.


1. Backup your SourceForge 2.5 installation (database, LDAP, etc.).

   ** This cannot be stressed enough. Installing the GForge transition package
   ** can and will overwrite or could destroy anything that is not backed up.


2. Modify your /etc/apt/sources.list

   # vi /etc/apt/sources.list

   Add the following lines:

   deb http://gforge.free.fr/debian stable/
   deb-src http://gforge.free.fr/debian stable/

   # apt-get update


3. Install the gforge-sourceforge-transition Debian package

   # apt-get install gforge-sourceforge-transition

   [ Problem #1 ]

   ** This is where I encountered my first problem. Below you will see that
   ** /etc/gforge/local.pl could not be found. That is because it doesn't
   ** exist yet, so we need to make it exist! See solution #1, below.

   sf:~# apt-get install gforge-sourceforge-transition

   Errors were encountered while processing:
    gforge-sourceforge-transition
   E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) 

   [ Solution #1 ]

   ** Use the SourceForge local.pl file. Reinstall gforge-sourceforge-transition
   ** Debian package.

   # cp /etc/sourceforge/local.pl /etc/gforge/   
   # apt-get install gforge-sourceforge-transition


4. Install the gforge Debian package 

   ** During this install you will be asked for the Debian (Woody) CDs (1, 2 
   ** and 3)
   ** 
   ** The installation of GForge is documented in serveral places so please
   ** refer to that documentation for the actual GForge install steps.

   # apt-get install gforge

   ** Take note that during the GForge installation there is one screen 
   ** titled "Configuring Mailman" that says:
  
   .                                                                        . 
   . Missing site list                                                      .
   .                                                                        .
   . Mailman needs a so-called "site list", which is the list from which    .
   . password reminders and such are sent out from.  This list needs to be  .
   . created before mailman will start.                                     .
   .                                                                        .
   . To create the list, run "newlist mailman" and follow the instructions  .
   . on-screen                                                              . 

   [ Problem #2 ]

   ** This really would not be a problem if you took note of the screen I
   ** mentioned above. But, in case you didn't here is what you might see:

   Creating config file /etc/mailman/qmail-to-mailman.py with new version
    cp -f /usr/share/mailman/qmail-to-mailman.py /etc/mailman/qmail-to-mailman.py
   Upgrading from version 0x2000bf0 to 0x20102f0
   getting rid of old source files
   Site list for mailman (usually named mailman) missing
   Please create it; until then, mailman will refuse to start

   dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of gforge-lists-mailman:

   < a bunch of dependancy messages cut out >

   E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

   [ Solution #2 ]

   ** Just as the screen I mentioned say run newlist. Restart the PostGreSQL
   ** server and reinstall the gforge Debian package.
   
   # /usr/sbin/newlist mailman
   # /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d postgresql start
   # apt-get install gforge


5. Check to see if the database was imported properly.

   ** There are two places that you can check to see if your SourceForge 2.5
   ** database dump  was imported into the new GForge database properly.

   a. /var/lib/gforge/sf_dump_for_gforge.*

      If sf_dump_for_gforge.ko exists then something failed.
      If sf_dump_for_gforge.ok exists then it most likely was successful.

   b. Check the database

      sf:~# psql -c "SELECT sum(*) FROM users;" -U gforge gforge
        sum
       -----
          2
       (1 row)

      If you have only two users then this result might be good, but I am
      willing to bet that there are more, so something must have failed. ;)


6. Manually import the database (optional)

   ** This of course only needs to be done if Step 5 indicates failure.

   # cd /var/lib/gforge/
   # /usr/share/gforge/bin/install-db.sh restore sf_dump_for_gforge.ko  

   ** Reinstall the gforge-db-postgresql Debian package (this will bring the
   ** database schema up-to-date.

   # apt-get install gforge-db-postgresql --reinstall


7. See Step 5b.
