Installation of FusionForge is a non-trivial undertaking, since it integrates
with so many different components across your system. A skilled sysadmin 
is required to pull it off, or at the least a great deal of patience.

The result of a complete installation means automatic creation of CVS 
and Subversion repositories, and having access to them controlled by 
FusionForge and stats gathered from them. ViewCVS (used for CVS and
Subversion browsing) are two additional integration points.

BASICS OF INSTALLATION
----------------------


For Ubuntu/Debian system, you should use the debian packaging, see
the fusionforge.org website for the correct instructions.

For an installation on CentOS or Red Hat, use the following command.

install.sh <hostname with domain>

That will install the bulk of the system and even set up a site admin
user account for you.

The information below may not be necessary if you succeeded installing
using the above method. However this info may give you an overview 
of how the installation is done.

OVERVIEW
--------

FusionForge has a lot of different pieces touching a lot of different components
in the system. Cronjobs are required to maintain the system, touching lots 
of files on a daily and hourly basis, including /etc/* system files.

The plugins that now manage the CVS and SVN functionality have made 
installation slightly harder because even more files have to be moved into
place during installation.

The manual installation of fusionforge is documented below. Be sure to follow
each step carefully, check the forums for frequently asked questions, 
and ask your Apache, mailman, and postgresql installation questions in the
corresponding mailing lists rather than on the gforge forums where little
help is available.


  CVS Overview
  ------------
  CVS is now managed via the scmcvs plugin which is included in the 
plugins/ directory in the tarball downloaded from gforge.org. Most 
of the files in scmcvs are intended for auto-installation on debian 
systems and DO NOT APPLY to the majority of users. The scmcvs plugin 
is activated by default in the gforge.sql database.

  Cronjobs for CVS are included in cronjobs/crontab.in, but are commented 
out by default for your security. cronjobs/cvs-cron/* contains the files 
that are executed hourly to build permissions and create blank cvs trees.
Make sure these files are executed as root, and have proper execution bits
set.  Each of these cronjobs has configuration parameters which you may 
have to edit manually the paths in those files for your specific system.


  SVN Overview
  ------------

  If you want to use GForge's svn-over-DAV support and apache2 are 
required.

  SVN is also managed via plugin - the scmsvn plugin is included and 
activated by default in gforge.

  The sample etc/gforge-httpd.conf.example file in this tarball contains 
a COMPLETE AND WORKING vhost for subversion-over-dav. The gforge-install.sh
script will copy this to /etc/gforge/httpd.conf You may have to 
alter the passwords and any other config options, but the sample config 
shown has been used in dozens or even hundreds of installs and DOES WORK.


  CVSTracker Overview
  -------------------
  The cvstracker plugin allows for some integration between CVS 
commits and the bug tracker and task manager. So, for example, 
when you commit, you can reference bug and task IDs in your 
commit message and have the commit linked to the corresponding
bug and task.

  This works by having a script in the cvs server issue a POST 
to the main website ( /plugins/cvstracker/newcommit.php )

  See the plugins/cvstracker/README file for details. This 
plugin is enabled by default in the gforge.sql database file. 
As with the other plugins, you may manually place the config 
files in /etc/gforge/plugins/cvstracker/ and uncomment the 
cronjob in crontab.in.


  PHP
  ---
  The cronjobs require the PHP CGI to be installed and the php.ini 
file to be properly configured with your include_path OR edit the 
crontab.in file to set your include path.

  Mailman
  -------

  Mailman is needed to create and use mailing lists with gforge. 
Mailman is frequently installed in /var/mailman/ and the sample 
vhost shown below will work with this setup without any changes.

  Cronjobs for mailman are located in cronjobs/mail/*

  cronjobs/mail/mailing_lists_create.php is used obviously to 
create new mailing lists. You may have to edit /etc/gforge/local.inc 
to change the location of the mailman bin/ directory.

  For all problems with mailman installation and use, contact 
the mailman mailing lists for help.


UPGRADING DATABASE - EXISTING INSTALL
-------------------------------------

To migrate to a newer version of GForge, you must import 
your old database, FRS files, mailing lists, cvs and svn trees
into your new installation.

1) Completely install your new system
2) Move the mentioned files into place
3) Import your old database
4) go into the gforge/db directory and choose 'startpoint.php 4.0.2' 
as the starting point of the installation (4.0.2 is an example)
5) ./upgrade-db.php - this script will run the updates in order. 
If any of them fail, it will prompt you to continue. Generally, 
you should always continue. Most are minor or informational errors.


WEB SETUP - MANUAL INSTALLATION
-------------------------------

The following are sample commands commonly issued for a manual installation:

tar -xjf gforge-X.X.tar.bz2
cd gforge-X.X

#
#	BEFORE RUNNING THIS, determine your apacheuser/group 
#	and pass it as an argument as shown below.
#
#	Argument 1: the main hostname you want to use.
#	Argument 2: the apache user
#	Argument 3: the apache group
#	Argument 3: the IP address that you are listening on
#
./gforge-install.sh gforge.company.com apacheuser apachegroup

#
#	jpgraph install - use the 1.9.1 version from gforge.org
#	as mentioned above
#
tar -xzf jpgraph-1.9.1.tar.gz
mv jpgraph-1.9.1/src/* /opt/jpgraph/

#you will have to edit jpgraph.php to set USE_CACHE=false
vim /opt/jpgraph/jpgraph.php

Apache will need to have a line added to its httpd.conf:

Include /etc/gforge/httpd.conf

Restart apache when you are done editing the file so the 
changes can be picked up.


PHP setup
---------

You may also add the include_path to the php.ini, as it will be
necessary for your php cgi to run the cron jobs.

register_globals = Off
magic_quotes_gpc = Off
file_uploads = On
include_path = ".:/opt/gforge/gforge/:/opt/gforge/gforge/www/include/:/etc/gforge/"

PHP CLI that is used by crontab.in may use different php.ini.  Find
it by running the following command and add the above include_path
directive there:

$ /usr/bin/php -i | fgrep php.ini


FRS - File Release System
-------------------------

FRS has been radically simplified. Simply create a directory and make
it owned by the webserver-user. Usually "chown -R apache:apache mydir"
will do the trick.

This directory will be referenced in the GForge Config File as $sys_upload_dir


GForge Config File
--------------

Edit the /etc/gforge/local.inc and set any specific variables 
like sys_default_domain and any paths to files that are not right


Site Admin
----------

Site admins are anyone who is an admin of group_id=1

To give the first user "Site Admin" privileges, register a new user,
and confirm it via the email link. Then enter the postgres command
line and issue these commands:

[gforge]# psql gforge

psql> SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE user_name='******MY NEW USERNAME*********';

The result of that query will be put into this next query:

psql> insert into user_group (user_id,group_id,admin_flags) values (*****YOUR NEW NUMERIC USER ID*****,1,'A');


Mail Aliases
------------

This alias was already added by the gforge-install script:

noreply:        /dev/null


PEER RATINGS
------------

Add yourself, and any others you wish, to the "Peer Ratings" project,
which should be at /projects/peerrating/ on the website. Make yourself
an "admin" of the project, and then proceed to "rate" other users on
the website.

Members of the "Peer Ratings" project, who are "admins" of the project
become the first trusted users. This is the only way to prime the pump
for the peer ratings system.


CRON JOBS
---------

Cron jobs are in the cronjobs/ directory and the README file contains
a sample crontab. This gives you the basic cronjobs for updating
certain statistics and data on the site.

/cronjobs/cvs-cron/ contains scripts useful for creating blank cvs 
trees and managing the /etc/groups /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files.
See /cronjobs/README.root for more info.

/cronjobs/mail/ contains files useful for the creation of new mailing 
lists in mailman and creating the /etc/aliases file.

**************************************************************************
WARNING!!! the following command will blow away any existing root crontab.
**************************************************************************

[root]# crontab cronjobs/crontab.in

Now edit the paths to the cron scripts:

[root]# crontab -e

IMPORTANT!!!! - the cvs-cron/usergroup.php cron script will meddle 
with your /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow files. By default,
this cron will save these files with a .new extension. You will have 
to edit the cron script to remove the .new extension, but you must 
make sure that it is properly generating your files or your server 
could be unusable.

Once you have manually run the usergroup.php file, look at the 
/etc/*.new files and verify that they contain sensisble information.
When you are confident they are right, you can edit usergroup.php 
to remove the .new extension and uncomment the cronjobs.


JPGRAPH
-------

The installation was shown above. Be sure to use the 1.9.1 version
from gforge.org and set USE_CACHE=false as shown here.

DEFINE("USE_CACHE",false);


ADDITIONAL FILES
----------------

For XHTML validation against the DTD, the following files must be
placed under the gforge/common/include/ directory:
* xhtml-lat1.ent
* xhtml-special.ent
* xhtml-symbol.ent
* xhtml1-strict.dtd
* xhtml1-transitional.dtd
They can be downloaded from http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/dtds.html
as tarball (xhtml1.tgz).

Installation of xmlstarlet is also required.

MOST COMMON PROBLEMS
--------------------

Q: I get a blank page when I visit http://gforge.company.com/

A: Most often you are missing the php-pgsql library that lets PHP
talk to the postgres database. Find a php-pgsql RPM or recompile 
php to have pgql support.

If you're sure you have php-pgsql support, you can edit 
common/include/database.php and remove the @ symbol from
this line:

	$conn = @pg_connect( 

So that it looks like:

	$conn = pg_connect(

This will let debug output dump to the screen and may let you find
the problem. Search the forums for more solutions.


Q: "Error Occurred In the Logger" or other database permission problems

A: As stated in the installation instructions, the database must be created, 
owned, and accessed by the gforge user. This user is the only one who will 
have total acess to all the tables. Any other user would have to be specifically 
granted permissions with the GRANT commands in postgres.


Q: Reporting or time tracking doesn't work

A: Go to the reporting tab and scroll down so you can choose 
"Initialize/Rebuild Reporting Tables"

You may also be missing GD support or be missing JPGraph or have it installed 
improperly. The jpgraph/src/ directory should be specified accurately in your 
local.inc file, and you should include a / at the end of the path specified.
In addition, you should modify jpgraph.php to set USE_CACHE=false


Q: How do I upgrade my database?

A: As stated above, you must apply the changes that are listed in date order 
in the db/ directory to your database. Only the changes that are not already 
in your old db/ directory should be applied, and they should be applied and 
checked IN ORDER.


Q: I'm getting an error about BaseLanguage.class not being found.

A: Make sure your localization path is correctly specified in the local.inc 
file and that it is readable AND writable by the apache user.


Q: When I click on "/projects/" or "/users/" links, I get the source code
instead of the page I expected.

A: As shown in the example httpd.conf files above, you may have to switch 
to using the <Files> or <Location> directives depending on your server
version.


Q: How do I backup GForge? 

A: The only proper way to backup the gforge database is with pg_dump. 
Any attempt to backup the filesystem while pgsql is running will result
in a useless and corrupt backup. You can backup CVS trees using tar as 
long as they are not actively and heavily used during the backup. 
Mailman and the FRS uploads dir can also be backed up with tar.


Q: Large uploads into FRS or the doc manager fail.

A: Apache and the php.ini file need to have upload limits and possibly 
memory limits increased.
