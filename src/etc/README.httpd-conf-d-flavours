The following information may be helpful to developers.

The different httpd.conf.d-*/ directories are *generated* out of
contents of 'httpd.conf.d/'. At the moment, there are 3 flavours of
these files ("fhs", "opt" and "usrlocal").

The script src/utils/manage-apache-config.sh must be used to
regenerate the files for these flavours.

Please make modifications in the source files inside 'httpd.conf.d/'
and regenerate.
