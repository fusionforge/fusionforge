The OpenDocument directory contains a copy of PEAR's OpenDocument package 
as downloaded from http://download.pear.php.net/package/OpenDocument-0.2.0.tgz 
on 20011/03/09.

Note that instead of using this version, the code now depends on the modified 
version managed in http://gitorious.org/php-opendocument/php-opendocument/commits/packages 
for the moment, until inclusion in upstream reference repository (contacted upstream author, 
and work in progress).
A corresponding patch is provided in opendocument-packages.patch
