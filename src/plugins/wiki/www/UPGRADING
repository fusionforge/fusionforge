To migrate to a new phpwiki installation you might want to backup your old pages
(best via a zip dump), configure your new installation, and restore the old

?action=upgrade

To upgrade default pages and some config settings
add "?action=upgrade" to your HomePage url and press "Enter", which will
do most of the upgrades automatically.
