== Page Explorer

First select pages and then define the action:

<?plugin-form WikiAdminSelect s="*" ?>

or call the available ~WikiAdmin actions directly:

| [[/Rimuovi]] | [[/Rename]] | [[/Replace]] | [[/SetAcl]] | [[/Chmod]] | [[/Chown]]

== User Management

PhpWiki:EmailVerification is currently non-strict, leaving some possible holes, which can be administrated below.

  This button will show a list of all users with registered emails and buttons to set the verification status manually.

  <<WikiAdminUtils
           action=email-verification
           label="Email Verification"
   >>

To prevent from robots eating all possible ressources in a short time, blocking from certain IP's or not-well-behaving user agents can be defined below. See PhpWiki:HowToBlockRobots and MeatBall:SurgeProtector. _Note: Not yet enabled._

== Cleanup

A Wiki SandBox is very easy to clean. Here you can restore it to
pristine condition by loading the default from pgsrc.

  [Rake the SandBox|phpwiki:?action=loadfile&source=pgsrc/SandBox].

----------

== Making Snapshots or Backups

=== ZIP files of database

These links lead to zip files, generated on the fly, which contain all
the pages in your Wiki. The zip file will be downloaded to your local
computer.

  This **[ZIP Snapshot | phpwiki:?action=zip]** contains only the
  latest versions of each page, while this **[ZIP Dump |
  phpwiki:?action=zip&include=all]** contains all archived versions.

  (If the PhpWiki is configured to allow it, anyone can download a zip
  file.)

If your php has ''zlib'' support, the files in the archive will be
compressed, otherwise they will just be stored.

=== Dump to directory

Here you can dump pages of your Wiki into a directory of your choice.

  <<WikiForm action=dumpserial>>

The most recent version of each page will written out to the
directory, one page per file. Your server must have write permissions
to the directory!

-----------
== Restoring

If you have dumped a set of pages from PhpWiki, you can reload them
here. Note that pages in your database will be overwritten; thus, if
you dumped your HomePage when you load it from this form it will
overwrite the one in your database now. If you want to be selective
just delete the pages from the directory (or zip file) which you don't
want to load.

=== Upload File

Here you can upload ZIP archives, or individual files from your
(client) machine.

  <<WikiForm action=upload>>

=== Load File

Here you can load ZIP archives, individual files or entire
directories. The file or directory must be local to the http
server. You can also use this form to load from an http: or ftp: URL.

  <<WikiForm action=loadfile>>
  <<WikiForm action=loadfile buttontext="Load & Overwrite" overwrite=1>>

=== Upgrade

Do some verification checks and upgrade changes automatically, after having installed a 
new phpwiki engine update:
* Upgrade new or changed page revisions from pgsrc,
* Upgrade the database schema (mysql _page.id auto_increment_, ADD _session.sess_ip_),

;:[ Upgrade | phpwiki:HomePage?action=upgrade ]

-----------

== Format of the files

Currently the pages are stored, one per file, as MIME (RFC:2045)
e-mail (RFC:822) messages. The content-type ''application/x-phpwiki''
is used, and page meta-data is encoded in the content-type
parameters. (If the file contains several versions of a page, it will
have type ''multipart/mixed'', and contain several sub-parts, each
with type ''application/x-phpwiki''.)  The message body contains the
page text.

=== Old Formats

**Serialized Files**

  The dump to directory command used to dump the pages as PHP
  ''serialized()'' strings. For humans, this made the files very hard
  to read, and nearly impossible to edit.

**Plain Files**

  Before that the page text was just dumped to a file--this means that
  all page meta-data was lost. Note that when loading ''plain files'',
  the page name is deduced from the file name.

The upload and load functions will automatically recognize each of
these three types of files, and handle them accordingly.

----

== Dump pages as XHTML

  <<WikiForm action=dumphtml>>

This will generate a directory of static pages suitable for
distribution on disk where no web server is available. The various
links for page editing functions and navigation are removed from the
pages.

  The XHTML file collection can also be downloaded as an
  **[XHTML ZIP Snapshot | phpwiki:?action=ziphtml]**.

----

== Phpwiki Internals

These are here mostly for debugging purposes (at least, that's the
hope.)

In normal use, you shouldn't need to use these, though, then again,
they shouldn't really do any harm.

=== Purge Markup Cache

(If your wiki is so configured,) the transformed (almost-HTML) content
of the most recent version of each page is cached. This speeds up page
rendering since parsing of the wiki-text takes a fair amount of juice.

  Hitting this button will delete all cached transformed
  content. (Each pages content will be transformed and re-cached next
  time someone views it.)

  <<WikiAdminUtils
           action=purge-cache
           label="Purge Cache"
   >>

=== Clean WikiDB of Illegal Filenames

Page names beginning with the subpage-separator, usually a slash
(=/=), are not allowed. Sometimes though an errant plugin or something
might create one....

  This button will delete any pages with illegal page names.

  <<WikiAdminUtils
           action=purge-bad-pagenames
           label="Exorcise WikiDB"
   >>
