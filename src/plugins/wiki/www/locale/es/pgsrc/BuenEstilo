"Young writers often suppose that style is a garnish for the meat of 
prose, a sauce by which a dull dish is made palatable. Style has no such 
separate entity; it is nondetachable, unfilterable. The beginner should 
approach style warily, realizing that it is himself he is approaching, no 
other; and he should begin by turning resolutely away from all devices 
that are popularly believed to indicate style--all mannerisms, tricks, 
adornments. The approach to style is by way of plainness, simplicity, 
orderliness, sincerity."
