<p>All pages that are in the <?php echo $SINGULAR?> category refer to this page.</p>

<h3>To create a page in the <?php echo $SINGULAR?> category</h3>

<ol>

<li>

Search to see if it already exists.  We don't want lots of
duplicate pages.  You can use this FuzzyPages search:

<?plugin-form FuzzyPages ?>

</li>

<li>

If it does not exist, you can create the page.  You can use this
CreatePage button, or see <?php $link = WikiLink("HowToUseWiki"); ?> <?php echo 
$link ?> for more ways to navigate or create pages.

<?php
  $bpage = "~~[" . $PAGENAME . "]";

  $initial_content = "\"This page is in the $bpage category.  You must leave in at least one reference to $bpage in order for this page to be in the $bpage category.  Otherwise, edit this text to describe your page.\"";
	$adder = "";
  
  //if($SELF_ON_CREATE == true){
  	//$adder = "save_and_redirect_to=\"" . $PAGENAME . "\"";
  //}	
  
  $this->_printPlugin("<" . "?plugin-form CreatePage " . $adder . " initial_content=" . $initial_content . " ?" . ">");
?>

</li>

<li>
Once you have created a page, it will simply appear in the list above.  If you would
like to add information about the page, click on its name in the list and edit and save the text.
To ensure that the page stays in this category, make sure <b>[<?php echo $PAGENAME?>]</b> is in the description somewhere (including the
brackets to be safe).

</li>
