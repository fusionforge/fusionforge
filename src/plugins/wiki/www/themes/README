*The default theme must always be present,* even when using another
theme! Wherever a theme has no specific variant (override) of a
template or button or image, PhpWiki will look for one in the default 
theme. Same with the language: 
Language and theme specific specific buttons will be search in 
sub-directories like <theme>/buttons/en, and if none will be found, 
the default buttons, which might be language-independent, in default/buttons 
will be used.

List of current themes:
