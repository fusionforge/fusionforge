== Page Explorer ==

First select pages and then define the action:

<?plugin-form WikiAdminSelect s="*" ?>

or call the available ~WikiAdmin actions directly:

| [[/Chown]] | [[/Purge]] | [[/Remove]] | [[/Rename]] | [[/SearchReplace]] | [[/SetAcl]] | [[/SetAclSimple]]

== Global Access Rights ==

These action pages will allow you to set the default access rights for wiki pages.
Pages without individual access rights will use these default access rights.
* [[SetGlobalAccessRightsSimple]]
* [[SetGlobalAccessRights]]

== Cleanup ==

A Wiki SandBox is very easy to clean. Here you can restore it to
pristine condition by loading the default from pgsrc.

**[[phpwiki:?action=loadfile&overwrite=1&source=pgsrc/SandBox|Rake the SandBox]]**

== Making Snapshots or Backups ==

=== ZIP files of database ===

These links lead to zip files, generated on the fly, which contain all
the pages in your Wiki. The zip file will be downloaded to your local
computer.

This **[[phpwiki:?action=zip|ZIP Snapshot]]** contains only the
latest versions of each page, while this **[[phpwiki:?action=zip&include=all|ZIP Dump]]** contains all archived versions.

(If the ~PhpWiki is configured to allow it, anyone can download a zip file.)

If your php has //zlib// support, the files in the archive will be compressed, otherwise they will just be stored.

=== Dump to directory ===

Here you can dump pages of your Wiki into a directory of your choice.

<<WikiForm action=dumpserial>>

The most recent version of each page will written out to the directory, one page per file. Your server must have write permissions to the directory!

== Restoring ==

If you have dumped a set of pages from ~PhpWiki, you can reload them
here. Note that pages in your database will be overwritten; thus, if
you dumped your HomePage when you load it from this form it will
overwrite the one in your database now. If you want to be selective
just delete the pages from the directory (or zip file) which you don't
want to load.

=== Upload File ===

Here you can upload ZIP archives, or individual files from your
(client) machine.

<<WikiForm action=upload>>

=== Load File ===

Here you can load ZIP archives, individual files or entire
directories. The file or directory must be local to the http
server. You can also use this form to load from an http: or ftp: URL.

<<WikiForm action=loadfile>>
<<WikiForm action=loadfile buttontext="Load & Overwrite" overwrite=1>>

=== Upgrade ===

Do some verification checks and upgrade changes automatically, after having installed a
new phpwiki engine update:
* Upgrade new or changed page revisions from pgsrc,
* Upgrade the database schema (mysql //page.id auto_increment//, ADD //session.sess_ip//),

You can force overwrite or not:
* **[[phpwiki:HomePage?action=upgrade|Upgrade]]**
* **[[phpwiki:HomePage?action=upgrade&overwrite=1|Upgrade & Overwrite]]**

== Format of the files ==

Currently the pages are stored, one per file, as MIME (RFC:2045)
e-mail (RFC:822) messages. The content-type //application/x-phpwiki//
is used, and page meta-data is encoded in the content-type
parameters. (If the file contains several versions of a page, it will
have type //multipart/mixed//, and contain several sub-parts, each
with type //application/x-phpwiki//.)  The message body contains the
page text.

== Dump pages as XHTML ==

<<WikiForm action=dumphtml>>

This will generate a directory of static pages suitable for
distribution on disk where no web server is available. The various
links for page editing functions and navigation are removed from the
pages.

The XHTML file collection can also be downloaded as an **[[phpwiki:?action=ziphtml|XHTML ZIP Snapshot]]**.
