<<WikiFormRich action=FuzzyPages method=GET nobr=1 class=wikiaction editbox[] name=s text="" submit[] >>

== Tips ==

* Separate words with a space. All words have to match as exact strings.

  <verbatim>
  Example: search for “databas” will NOT match the text “PGSQL database is a nice product.”
  </verbatim>
* Search for consecutive words by using quotes.

  <verbatim>
  Example: 'white dog' or "white dog" will match “This is a white dog.”
  </verbatim>
* Search for some special chars, such as @ ! &, in the keyword is allowed. Yet you can NOT search for such chars only.

  <verbatim>
  Example: ‘year!’ will match “Happy new year!”.
  </verbatim>

  <verbatim>
  Example: search for '!!!' will NOT return any result.
  </verbatim>
* Search can be done in any language, including Chinese.
* You can search titles in “Title Search” section, and search wiki contents in “Full Text Search” section.
