;=========================================================================
; If PHP needs help in finding where you installed the rest of the PhpWiki
; code, you can set the include_path here.
;
; Override PHP's include path so that it can find some needed additional libraries.
; You shouldn't need to do this unless your system include_path esp. your 
; system pear libs are broken or oudated. The PHPWIKI_DIR is automatically 
; put to the front and the local lib/pear path is automatically added to the end.
; But if you define it, be sure to include either the system pear path or 
; the phpwiki/lib/pear path to override your Pear_DB.
; Note that on Windows-based servers, you should use ; rather than :
; as the path separator.
;INCLUDE_PATH = ".:/usr/local/httpd/phpwiki:/usr/share/pear"

; Set DEBUG to 1 to view the XHTML and CSS validator icons, page
; processing timer, and possibly other debugging messages at the
; bottom of each page. 65 for a more verbose level with AUTH hints. 
; See lib/config.php for all supported values.
; Default: 0

; PhpWiki can generate an access_log (in "NCSA combined log" format)

; By default PhpWiki will try to have PHP compress its output
; before sending it to the browser, if you have a recent enough
; version of PHP and the browser and action supports it.
;
; Define COMPRESS_OUTPUT to false to prevent output compression.
; Define COMPRESS_OUTPUT to true to force output compression,

; fashion.
; Leave it undefined to leave the choice up to PhpWiki. (Recommended)
;
; WARNING: Compressing the output has been reported to cause problems
; when PHP is running on MacOSX or on redirected requests.
; This setting should now be correctly determined automatically.
;COMPRESS_OUTPUT = false

; This controls how PhpWiki sets the HTTP cache control
; headers (Expires: and Cache-Control:) 
;
; Choose one of:
;
; NO_CACHE: This is roughly the old (pre 1.3.4) behavior.  PhpWiki will
;       instruct proxies and browsers never to cache PhpWiki output.
;       This was previously called 'NONE', but NONE was treated specially 
;       by parse_ini_config().
;
; STRICT: Cached pages will be invalidated whenever the database global
;       timestamp changes.  This should behave just like NO_CACHE (modulo
;       bugs in PhpWiki and your proxies and browsers), except that
;       things will be slightly more efficient.
;
; LOOSE: Cached pages will be invalidated whenever they are edited,
;       or, if the pages include plugins, when the plugin output could
;       concievably have changed.
;
;       Behavior should be much like STRICT, except that sometimes
;       wikilinks will show up as undefined (with the question mark)
;       when in fact they refer to (recently) created pages.
;       (Hitting your browsers reload or perhaps shift-reload button
;       should fix the problem.)
;
; ALLOW_STALE: Proxies and browsers will be allowed to used stale pages.
;       (The timeout for stale pages is controlled by CACHE_CONTROL_MAX_AGE.)
;
;       This setting will result in quirky behavior.  When you edit a
;       page your changes may not show up until you shift-reload the
;       page, etc...
;
;       This setting is generally not advisable, however it may be useful
;       in certain cases (e.g. if your wiki gets lots of page views,
;       and few edits by knowledgable people who won't freak over the quirks.)
;
; The recommended default is currently LOOSE.
;
CACHE_CONTROL = LOOSE

; Maximum page staleness, in seconds.
;
; This only has effect if CACHE_CONTROL is set to ALLOW_STALE.
CACHE_CONTROL_MAX_AGE = 600

; PhpWiki normally caches a preparsed version (i.e. mostly
; converted to HTML) of the most recent version of each page.
; (Parsing the wiki-markup takes a fair amount of CPU.)
; Define WIKIDB_NOCACHE_MARKUP to true to disable the
; caching of marked-up page content.
; Note that you can also disable markup caching on a per-page
; temporary basis by addinging a query arg of '?nocache=1'
; to the URL to the page or by adding a NoCache plugin line. 
; Use '?nocache=purge' to completely discard the cached version of the page.
; You can also purge the cached markup globally by using the
; "Purge Markup Cache" button on the PhpWikiAdministration page.
; Enable only for old php's with low memory or memory_limit=8MB.

; if you want to enable different users on different wikis on the same host.
;COOKIE_DOMAIN = "/"

; The login code now uses PHP's session support. Usually, the default
; configuration of PHP is to store the session state information in
; /tmp. That probably will work fine, but fails e.g. on clustered
; servers where each server has their own distinct /tmp (this is the
; case on SourceForge's project web server.) You can specify an
; alternate directory in which to store state information like so
; (whatever user your httpd runs as must have read/write permission
; in this directory)

;======================================================================
; Part Two: Database Selection
;======================================================================

; Select the database backend type:
;
;       SQL:   access one of several SQL databases using the PEAR DB library.
;       ADODB: uses the ADODB library for data access.     (most general)
;       PDO:   The new PHP5 dataobkject library. (experimental, no paging yet)
;       dba:   use one of the standard UNIX dbm libraries. Use BerkeleyDB (db3,4) (fastest)
;       file:  use a serialized file database. (easiest)
;       flatfile:  use a flat file database. (experimental, readable, slow)
;       cvs:   use a CVS server to store everything. (experimental, slowest, not recommended)
DATABASE_TYPE = dba
   
; Prefix for filenames or table names
;
; Currently you MUST EDIT THE SQL file too (in the schemas/
; directory because we aren't doing on the fly sql generation
; during the installation.
; Note: This prefix is NOT prepended to the default DBAUTH_
;       tables user, pref and member!
;DATABASE_PREFIX = phpwiki_

; For SQL based backends, specify the database as a DSN (Data Source Name),
; a kind of URL for databases.
;
; The most general form of a DSN looks like:
;
;       dbtype(dbsyntax)://username:password@protocol+hostspec/database?option=value&option2=value2
;
; For a MySQL database, the following should work:
;
;       mysql://user:password@host/databasename
;
; To connect over a unix socket, use something like
;
;       mysql://user:password@unix(/path/to/socket)/databasename
;
; Valid values for dbtype are mysql, pgsql, or sqlite.
;
DATABASE_DSN = "mysql://guest@unix(/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock)/test"

; Keep persistent connections: (mysql_pconnect, ...)
; Recommended is false for bigger servers, and true for small servers 
; with not so many connections. postgresql: Please leave it false. Default: false
; Should really be set as database option in the DSN above.
DATABASE_PERSISTENT = false

; A table to store session information.  Only needed by SQL backends.
;
; A word of warning - any prefix defined above will be prepended to whatever
; is given here.
DATABASE_SESSION_TABLE = session

; For the file and dba backends, this specifies where the data files will be
; located.  Ensure that the user that the webserver runs as has write access
; to this directory.
;
; WARNING: leaving this as the default of '/tmp' will almost guarantee that
; you'll lose your wiki data at some stage.
DATABASE_DIRECTORY = /tmp

; For the dba backend, this defines which DBA variant you wish to use.
;       gdbm - commonly available, Fedora not. Not recommended anymore.
;       db2 - Berkeley DB v2; not supported by modern versions of PHP.
;       db3 - Berkeley DB v3; as per db2. The best on Windows.
;       db4 - Berkeley DB v4; current version, however PHP has some issues
;               with it's db4 support.
;       dbm - Older dba handler; suffers from limits on the size of data
;               items.
; Better not use other hacks such as inifile, flatfile or cdb.
DATABASE_DBA_HANDLER = db4

; How long will the system wait for a database operation to complete?
; Specified in seconds.
DATABASE_TIMEOUT = 12

; How often to try and optimise the database. Specified in seconds. 
; Set to 0 to disable optimisation completely. Default is 50 (seconds).
;
; This is a fairly crude way of doing things as it requires a page save
; to occur during the right minute for the optimisation to be triggered. 
;
; With most modern databases (eg. Postgres) and distributions (eg. Debian)
; the system maintenance scripts take care of this nightly, so you will want
; to set this parameter to 0 (disabled).
;DATABASE_OPTIMISE_FREQUENCY = 50

; Optional: Administrative SQL DB access (for action=upgrade)
; If action=upgrade detects (My)SQL problems, but has no ALTER permissions, 
; give here a database username which has the necessary ALTER or CREATE permissions.
; Of course you can fix your database manually. See lib/upgrade.php for known issues.
;DBADMIN_USER = root

; Optional: Administrative SQL DB access (for action=upgrade)

; Default: true
;USECACHE = false

;========================================================================
; Section 3a: Page revisions
;
; The next section controls how many old revisions of each page are
; kept in the database.
;========================================================================

; There are two basic classes of revisions: major and minor. Which
; class a revision belongs in is determined by whether the author
; checked the "this is a minor revision" checkbox when they saved the
; page.
; 
; There is, additionally, a third class of revisions: author
; revisions. The most recent non-mergable revision from each distinct
; author is an author revision.
;
; The expiry parameters for each of those three classes of revisions
; can be adjusted seperately. For each class there are five
; parameters (usually, only two or three of the five are actually
; set) which control how long those revisions are kept in the
; database.
;
;   MAX_KEEP: If set, this specifies an absolute maximum for the
;             number of archived revisions of that class. This is
;             meant to be used as a safety cap when a non-zero
;             min_age is specified. It should be set relatively high,
;             and it's purpose is to prevent malicious or accidental
;             database overflow due to someone causing an
;             unreasonable number of edits in a short period of time.
;
;   MIN_AGE:  Revisions younger than this (based upon the supplanted
;             date) will be kept unless max_keep is exceeded. The age
;             should be specified in days. It should be a
;             non-negative, real number,
;
;   MIN_KEEP: At least this many revisions will be kept.
;
;   KEEP: No more than this many revisions will be kept.
;
;   MAX_AGE:  No revision older than this age will be kept.
;
; Definitions of terms used above:
;
; Supplanted date: Revisions are timestamped at the instant that they
; cease being the current revision. Revision age is computed using
; this timestamp, not the edit time of the page.
;
; Merging: When a minor revision is deleted, if the preceding
; revision is by the same author, the minor revision is merged with
; the preceding revision before it is deleted. Essentially: this
; replaces the content (and supplanted timestamp) of the previous
; revision with the content after the merged minor edit, the rest of
; the page metadata for the preceding version (summary, mtime, ...)
; is not changed.
;
; Let all revisions be stored. Default since 1.3.11
;MAJOR_MIN_KEEP = 2147483647
;MINOR_MIN_KEEP = 2147483647

; Keep up to 8 major edits, but keep them no longer than a month.

; Keep up to 4 minor edits, but keep them no longer than a week.
MINOR_MAX_AGE = 7

; Keep the latest contributions of the last 8 authors up to a year.
; Additionally, (in the case of a particularly active page) try to

; if there are more than eight of them,) but in no case keep more
; than twenty unique author revisions.

;========================================================================
; Part Three: User Authentication
;========================================================================
;
; New user authentication configuration:
; We support three basic authentication methods and a stacked array 
; of advanced auth methods to get and check the passwords:
;
; ALLOW_ANON_USER         default true
; ALLOW_ANON_EDIT         default true
; ALLOW_BOGO_LOGIN        default true
; ALLOW_USER_PASSWORDS    default true

; allow anon users to view or edit any existing pages
ALLOW_ANON_USER = true
; allow anon users to edit pages
ALLOW_ANON_EDIT = true

; If ALLOW_BOGO_LOGIN is true, users are allowed to login (with
; any/no password) using any userid which: 
;  1) is not the ADMIN_USER, and
;  2) is a valid WikiWord (matches $WikiNameRegexp.)
; If true, users may be created by themselves. Otherwise we need seperate auth. 
; If such a user will create a so called HomePage with his userid, he will 
; be able to store his preferences and password there.
ALLOW_BOGO_LOGIN = true

; True User Authentication:
; To require user passwords:
;   ALLOW_ANON_USER = false
;   ALLOW_ANON_EDIT = false
;   ALLOW_BOGO_LOGIN = false,
;   ALLOW_USER_PASSWORDS = true.
; Otherwise any anon or bogo user might login without any or a wrong password.
ALLOW_USER_PASSWORDS = true

; Many different methods can be used to check user's passwords:
;   BogoLogin:     WikiWord username, with no *actual* password checking,
;                   although the user will still have to enter one.
;   PersonalPage:  Store passwords in the users homepage metadata (simple)
;   Db:            Use DBAUTH_AUTH_* (see below) with PearDB or 
;                   ADODB only.
;   LDAP:          Authenticate against LDAP_AUTH_HOST with LDAP_BASE_DN
;   IMAP:          Authenticate against IMAP_AUTH_HOST (email account)
;   POP3:          Authenticate against POP3_AUTH_HOST (email account)
;   Session:       Get username and level from a PHP session variable
;                  (e.g. for FusionForge)
;   File:          Store username:crypted-passwords in .htaccess like files. 
;                  Use Apache's htpasswd to manage this file.
;   HttpAuth:      Use the protection by the webserver (.htaccess/.htpasswd)
;                  Note that the ADMIN_USER should exist also.
;                  Using HttpAuth disables all other methods and no userauth sessions are used.
;		   With mod_ntlm and mod_auth_sspi use this. (automatic login with MSIE)
;

; Part Four: Page appearance and layout
;========================================================================

; THEMES
;
; Most of the page appearance is controlled by files in the theme
; subdirectory.
;
; There are a number of pre-defined themes shipped with PhpWiki.
; Or you may create your own (e.g. by copying and then modifying one of
; stock themes.)
;
; The complete list of installed themes can be found by doing 'ls themes/'
; from the root of your PHPWiki installation.
;
; white on yellow with fat blue links:
;THEME = default
; a MonoBook extension, the new default
THEME = Sidebar
; almost fully iconized classic grey MacOSX design:

; http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets. Note that PhpWiki
; has been extensively tested only with the latin1 (iso-8859-1)
; and utf-8 character sets.
;
; If you change the default with existing pages, 
; PhpWiki may not work properly and will require modifications in all existing pages. 
; You'll have to dump the old pages with the old charset
; and import it into the new one after having changed the charset.
; Currently we support utf-8 for all languages, euc-jp for ja
; and iso-8859-1 for all langs except ja and zh. Changing languages (UserPreferences) 
; from one charset to another will not work!
;
; Character sets similar to iso-8859-1 may work with little or no
; modification depending on your setup. The database must also
; support the same charset, and of course the same is true for the
; web browser. euc-jp and utf-8 works ok, but only is mbstring is used.
CHARSET = utf-8

; Most exotic charsets are not supported by htmlspecialchars, which prints a warning:
; "charset `bla' not supported, assuming iso-8859-1"

; Japanese "ja" (Japanese   - ホームページ)
; Chinese  "zh" (Chinese    - 首頁)
;
; If you set DEFAULT_LANGUAGE to the empty string, the users

;DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = en

; WIKI_PGSRC -- specifies the source for the initial page contents of
; the Wiki. The setting of WIKI_PGSRC only has effect when the wiki is

; WIKI_PGSRC can either name a directory or a zip file. In either case
; WIKI_PGSRC is scanned for files -- one file per page.
;WIKI_PGSRC = pgsrc

; DEFAULT_WIKI_PGSRC is only used when the language is *not* the

; Separate each of the protocol names with a vertical pipe, and ensure there
; is no extraneous whitespace.
;ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS = "http|https|mailto|ftp|news|nntp|ssh|gopher"

; URLs ending with the following extension should be inlined as images.
; Specify as per ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS.
; Note that you can now also allow class|svg|svgz|vrml|swf ...,
; which will create embedded object instead of img. 
; Typical CGI extensions as pl or cgi maybe allowed too, 
; but those two will be enforced to img.
;INLINE_IMAGES = "png|jpg|jpeg|gif"

; Perl regexp for WikiNames ("bumpy words"):
;   (?<!..) & (?!...) used instead of '\b' because \b matches '_' as well
; Allow digits: BumpyVersion132
;   WIKI_NAME_REGEXP = "(?<![[:alnum:]])(?:[[:upper:]][[:lower:][:digit:]]+){2,}(?![[:alnum:]])"

; InterWiki linking -- wiki-style links to other wikis on the web
;
; The map will be taken from a page name InterWikiMap.

; used as the keyword.
;
; The default behavior is to match Category* or Topic* links.
;KEYWORDS = "Category* OR Topic*"

; Author and Copyright Site Navigation Links
;
; These will be inserted as &lt;link rel&gt; tags in the html header of

;==========================================================================
; Part Six: URL options.
;==========================================================================
;
; You can probably skip this section.

; The following section contains settings which you can use to tailor
; the URLs which PhpWiki generates.
;
; Any of these parameters which are left undefined will be deduced
; automatically. You need only set them explicitly if the
; auto-detected values prove to be incorrect.
;
; In most cases the auto-detected values should work fine, so
; hopefully you don't need to mess with this section.
;
; In case of local overrides of short placeholders, which themselves 
; include index.php, we check for most constants. See '/wiki'.
; We can override DATA_PATH and PHPWIKI_DIR to support multiple phpwiki 
; versions (for development), but most likely other values like 
; THEME, LANG and DbParams for a WikiFarm.

; Canonical name and httpd port of the server on which this PhpWiki
; resides.
;/
;SERVER_NAME = some.host.com
;SERVER_PORT = 80

; https needs a special setting
;SERVER_PROTOCOL = http 

; Relative URL (from the server root) of the PhpWiki
; script.
;SCRIPT_NAME = /some/where/index.php

; URL of the PhpWiki install directory.  (You only need to set this
; if you've moved index.php out of the install directory.)  This can
; be either a relative URL (from the directory where the top-level
; PhpWiki script is) or an absolute one.
;DATA_PATH = /home/user/phpwiki

; Path to the PhpWiki install directory.  This is the local
; filesystem counterpart to DATA_PATH.  (If you have to set
; DATA_PATH, your probably have to set this as well.)  This can be
; either an absolute path, or a relative path interpreted from the
; directory where the top-level PhpWiki script (normally index.php)
; resides.
;PHPWIKI_DIR = /home/user/public_html/phpwiki

; PhpWiki will try to use short urls to pages, eg 
; http://www.example.com/index.php/HomePage
; If you want to use urls like 
; http://www.example.com/index.php?pagename=HomePage
; then define 'USE_PATH_INFO' as false by uncommenting the line below.
; NB:  If you are using Apache >= 2.0.30, then you may need to to use
; the directive "AcceptPathInfo On" in your Apache configuration file
; (or in an appropriate <.htaccess> file) for the short urls to work:  
; See http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#acceptpathinfo
; 
; See also http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/PrettyWiki for more ideas
; on prettifying your urls.
;
; Note that Google doesn't follow the default /index.php/PageName links.
; You must use either a PrettyWiki setup (see below), or force USE_PATH_INFO=false.
;
; Default: PhpWiki will try to divine whether use of PATH_INFO
; is supported in by your webserver/PHP configuration, and will
; use PATH_INFO if it thinks that is possible.
;USE_PATH_INFO = false

; VIRTUAL_PATH is the canonical URL path under which your your wiki
; appears. Normally this is the same as dirname(SCRIPT_NAME), however
; using, e.g. apaches mod_actions (or mod_rewrite), you can make it
; something different.
;
; If you do this, you should set VIRTUAL_PATH here.
;
; E.g. your phpwiki might be installed at at /scripts/phpwiki/index.php,
; but  * you've made it accessible through eg. /wiki/HomePage.
;
; One way to do this is to create a directory named 'wiki' in your
; server root. The directory contains only one file: an .htaccess
; file which reads something like:
;
;    Action x-phpwiki-page /scripts/phpwiki/index.php
;    SetHandler x-phpwiki-page
;    DirectoryIndex /scripts/phpwiki/index.php
;
; In that case you should set VIRTUAL_PATH to '/wiki'.
;
; (VIRTUAL_PATH is only used if USE_PATH_INFO is true.)
;/
;VIRTUAL_PATH = /SomeWiki

; Override the default uploads dir. We have to define the local file path,
; and the webpath (DATA_PATH). Ensure an ending slash on both. 
;UPLOAD_FILE_PATH = /var/www/htdocs/uploads/

; In case your system has no idea about /tmp, TEMP or TMPDIR, 
; better provide it here. E.g. needed for zipdumps.
;TEMP_DIR = /tmp

;===========================================================================
; Part Seven: Miscellaneous settings

; encoding.  If you're actually thinking of mailing the raw page dumps,
; then this might be useful, since (among other things,) it ensures
; that all lines in the message body are under 80 characters in length.
;
; Also, setting this will cause a few additional mail headers
; to be generated, so that the resulting dumps are valid
; RFC 2822 e-mail messages.
;
; Probably you can just leave this set to false, in which case you get
; raw ('binary' content-encoding) page dumps.

; Disable HTTP redirects.
; (You probably don't need to touch this.)
;
; PhpWiki uses HTTP redirects for some of it's functionality.
; (e.g. after saving changes, PhpWiki redirects your browser to
; view the page you just saved.)
; Some web service providers (notably free European Lycos) don't seem to
; allow these redirects.  (On Lycos the result in an "Internal Server Error"
; report.)  In that case you can set DISABLE_HTTP_REDIRECT to true.
; (In which case, PhpWiki will revert to sneakier tricks to try to
; redirect the browser...)
;DISABLE_HTTP_REDIRECT = true

; If you get a crash at loading LinkIcons you might want to disable 
; the getimagesize() function, which crashes on certain php versions and

; Part Eight: PLUGINCACHED Pear/Cache Settings
;===========================================================================

; Cache_Container storage class: 'file' is the fastest. See pear/Cache/Container/
;PLUGIN_CACHED_DATABASE = file

; This is only used if database is set to file.
; The webserver must have write access to this dir!
;PLUGIN_CACHED_CACHE_DIR = /tmp/cache
; Every file name in the cache begins with this prefix
;PLUGIN_CACHED_FILENAME_PREFIX = phpwiki

; The maximum total space in bytes of all files in the cache. When
; highwater is exceeded, a garbage collection will start.  It will
; collect garbage till 'lowwater' is reached.  Default: 4 * Megabyte
;PLUGIN_CACHED_HIGHWATER = 4194304
; Default: 3 * Megabyte
;PLUGIN_CACHED_LOWWATER  = 3145728

; If an image has not been used for maxlifetime remove it from the
; cache. (Since there is also the highwater/lowwater mechanism and an
; image usually requires only 1kb you don't have to make it very
; small, I think.)  
; Default: 30 * Day (30 * 24*60*60)
;PLUGIN_CACHED_MAXLIFETIME = 2592000

; Number of characters allowed to be send as 
; parameters in the url before using sessions
; vars instead. 
; Usually send plugin arguments as URL, but when they become
; longer than maxarglen store them in session variables.
; Setting it to 3000 worked fine for me, 30000 completely
; crashed my linux, 1000 should be safe.
;PLUGIN_CACHED_MAXARGLEN = 1000

; Actually use the cache (should be always true unless you are
; debugging). If you want to avoid the usage of a cache but need
; WikiPlugins that nevertheless rely on a cache you might set
; 'PLUGIN_CACHED_USECACHE' to false. You still need to set
; 'PLUGIN_CACHED_CACHE_DIR' appropriately to allow image creation and
; you should set 'PLUGIN_CACHED_FORCE_SYNCMAP' to false.
;PLUGIN_CACHED_USECACHE = true

; Will prevent image creation for an image map 'on demand'. It is a
; good idea to set this to 'true' because it will also prevent the
; html part not to fit to the image of the map.  If you don't use a
; cache, you have to set it to 'false', maps will not work otherwise
; but strange effects may happen if the output of an image map
; producing WikiPlugin is not completely determined by its parameters.
; (As it is the case for a graphical site map.)
;PLUGIN_CACHED_FORCE_SYNCMAP = true

; If ImageTypes() does not exist (PHP < 4.0.2) allow the
; following image formats (IMG_PNG | IMG_GIF | IMG_JPG | IMG_WBMP)

;   libgd, libpng, libjpeg, libungif, libtiff, libgd2, ...
