;  If PHP needs help in finding where you installed the rest of the PhpWiki
;  code, you can set the include_path here.
;  
; 
; Override PHP's include path so that it can find some needed additional libraries.
;  You shouldn't need to do this unless your system include_path esp. your 
;  system pear libs are broken or oudated. The PHPWIKI_DIR is automatically 
;  put to the front and the local lib/pear path is automatically added to the end.
;  But if you define it, be sure to include either the system pear path or 
;  the phpwiki/lib/pear path to override your Pear_DB.
;  Note that on Windows-based servers, you should use ; rather than :
;  as the path separator.

; HTTP CACHE_CONTROL
; 
; This controls how PhpWiki sets the HTTP cache control
; headers (Expires: and Cache-Control:) 
; 
; Choose one of:

; 
; NO_CACHE
; This is roughly the old (pre 1.3.4) behaviour.  PhpWiki will
;     instruct proxies and browsers never to cache PhpWiki output.
; 
; STRICT
; Cached pages will be invalidated whenever the database global
;     timestamp changes.  This should behave just like NONE (modulo
;     bugs in PhpWiki and your proxies and browsers), except that
;     things will be slightly more efficient.
; 
; LOOSE
; Cached pages will be invalidated whenever they are edited,
;     or, if the pages include plugins, when the plugin output could
;     concievably have changed.
; 
;     Behavior should be much like STRICT, except that sometimes
;        wikilinks will show up as undefined (with the question mark)
;        when in fact they refer to (recently) created pages.
;        (Hitting your browsers reload or perhaps shift-reload button
;        should fix the problem.)
; 
; ALLOW_STALE
; Proxies and browsers will be allowed to used stale pages.
;     (The timeout for stale pages is controlled by CACHE_CONTROL_MAX_AGE.)
; 
;     This setting will result in quirky behavior.  When you edit a
;        page your changes may not show up until you shift-reload the
;        page, etc...
; 
;     This setting is generally not advisable, however it may be useful
;        in certain cases (e.g. if your wiki gets lots of page views,
;        and few edits by knowledgable people who won't freak over the quirks.)

;  Define WIKIDB_NOCACHE_MARKUP to true to disable the
;  caching of marked-up page content.
;  Note that you can also disable markup caching on a per-page
;  temporary basis by addinging a query arg of '?nocache=1'
;  to the URL to the page or by adding a NoCache plugin line. 
;  Use '?nocache=purge' to completely discard the cached version of the page.

; Part Two:
; Database Configuration
; 
;=========================================================================

; Select the database backend type:
;  
; 
; 
DATABASE_TYPE = SQL

; For SQL based backends, specify the database as a DSN
; The most general form of a DSN looks like:
; 
;   phptype(dbsyntax)://username:password@protocol+hostspec/database?option=value
; 
; For a MySQL database, the following should work:
; 
;    mysql://user:password@host/databasename
; 
; To connect over a unix socket, use something like
; 
;    mysql://user:password@unix(/path/to/socket)/databasename
; 
; 
;   DATABASE_DSN = mysql://guest@:/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock/phpwiki
;   DATABASE_DSN = mysql://guest@localhost/phpwiki
;   DATABASE_DSN = pgsql://localhost/user_phpwiki
; 


; SQL DB types. The DSN hosttype.


; SQL User Id:


; SQL Password:


; SQL Database Hostname:
; 
; To connect over a local named socket, use something like
; 
;   unix(/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock)
; 
; here. 
; mysql on Windows via named pipes might need 127.0.0.1


; SQL Database Name:


; Calculated from the settings above:
DATABASE_DSN = "mysql://root:root@localhost/wiki"

; Used by all DB types:
; 
; Prefix for filenames or table names, e.g. "phpwiki_"
; 
; Currently <b>you MUST EDIT THE SQL file too!</b> (in the schemas/
; directory because we aren't doing on the fly sql generation
; during the installation.
; 
; Note: This prefix is NOT prepended to the default DBAUTH_
;       tables user, pref and member!
; 
;DATABASE_PREFIX = ""

; Keep persistent connections: (mysql_pconnect, ...)
;  Recommended is false for bigger servers, and true for small servers 
;  with not so many connections. postgresql: Please leave it false. Default: false
;  Should really be set as database option in the DSN above.
;  
DATABASE_PERSISTENT = false

; Tablename to store session information. Only supported by SQL backends.
; 
; A word of warning - any prefix defined above will be prepended to whatever is given here.
; 
DATABASE_SESSION_TABLE = "session"

; For the file and dba backends, this specifies where the data files will be
;  located.  Ensure that the user that the webserver runs as has write access
;  to this directory.
;  
; 
; WARNING: leaving this as the default of '/tmp' will almost guarantee that
;  you'll lose your wiki data at some stage.
;  
DATABASE_DIRECTORY = "/tmp"

; Use 'gdbm', 'dbm', 'db2', 'db3' or 'db4' depending on your DBA handler methods supported: <br >  
; 
; Better not use other hacks such as inifile, flatfile or cdb
DATABASE_DBA_HANDLER = gdbm

; Recommended values are 10-20 seconds. The more load the server has, the higher the timeout.
DATABASE_TIMEOUT = 20

; How often to try and optimise the database. Specified in seconds. 
;  Set to 0 to disable optimisation completely. Default is 50 (seconds).
;  
; 
; This is a fairly crude way of doing things as it requires a page save
;  to occur during the right minute for the optimisation to be triggered. 
;  
; 
; With most modern databases (eg. Postgres) and distributions (eg. Debian)
;  the system maintenance scripts take care of this nightly, so you will want
;  to set this parameter to 0 (disabled).
;  
DATABASE_OPTIMISE_FREQUENCY = 50

; Optional: Administrative SQL DB access (for action=upgrade)
;  If action=upgrade detects (My)SQL problems, but has no ALTER permissions, 
;  give here a database username which has the necessary ALTER or CREATE permissions.
;  Of course you can fix your database manually. See lib/upgrade.php for known issues.

;  Default: true
;  
USECACHE = true

; 
; Section 2a: Archive Cleanup
; The next section controls how many old revisions of each page are kept in the database.
; 
; There are two basic classes of revisions: major and minor. Which
; class a revision belongs in is determined by whether the author
; checked the "this is a minor revision" checkbox when they saved the
; page.
;  
; There is, additionally, a third class of revisions: author
; revisions. The most recent non-mergable revision from each distinct
; author is and author revision.
; 
; The expiry parameters for each of those three classes of revisions
; can be adjusted seperately. For each class there are five
; parameters (usually, only two or three of the five are actually
; set) which control how long those revisions are kept in the
; database.
; 
;    max_keep: If set, this specifies an absolute maximum for the
;             number of archived revisions of that class. This is
;             meant to be used as a safety cap when a non-zero
;             min_age is specified. It should be set relatively high,
;             and it's purpose is to prevent malicious or accidental
;             database overflow due to someone causing an
;             unreasonable number of edits in a short period of time.
; 
;   min_age:  Revisions younger than this (based upon the supplanted
;             date) will be kept unless max_keep is exceeded. The age
;             should be specified in days. It should be a
;             non-negative, real number,
; 
;   min_keep: At least this many revisions will be kept.
; 
;   keep:     No more than this many revisions will be kept.
; 
;   max_age:  No revision older than this age will be kept.
; 
; Supplanted date: Revisions are timestamped at the instant that they
; cease being the current revision. Revision age is computed using
; this timestamp, not the edit time of the page.
; 
; Merging: When a minor revision is deleted, if the preceding
; revision is by the same author, the minor revision is merged with
; the preceding revision before it is deleted. Essentially: this
; replaces the content (and supplanted timestamp) of the previous
; revision with the content after the merged minor edit, the rest of
; the page metadata for the preceding version (summary, mtime, ...)
; is not changed.
; 


; Default: Keep for unlimited time. 
; Set to 0 to enable archive cleanup

; LDAP
; 	Authenticate against LDAP_AUTH_HOST with LDAP_BASE_DN.
; IMAP
; 	Authenticate against IMAP_AUTH_HOST (email account)
; POP3
; 	Authenticate against POP3_AUTH_HOST (email account)
; Session
; 	Get username and level from a PHP session variable. (e.g. for gforge)
; File
; 	Store username:crypted-passwords in .htaccess like files. 
;          Use Apache's htpasswd to manage this file.
; HttpAuth
; 	Use the protection by the webserver (.htaccess/.htpasswd) (experimental)
; 	Enforcing HTTP Auth not yet. Note that the ADMIN_USER should exist also.
;         Using HttpAuth disables all other methods and no userauth sessions are used.
