A **~WikiWikiWeb** is a site where everyone can collaborate on the
content. The most well-known and widely used Wiki is the Portland
Pattern Repository at http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?WikiWikiWeb.

You and I will find these statements there particularly relevant:

//The point is to make the [[Help:EditText|EditText]] form simple and the [[FindPage]]
search fast.//

//In addition to being quick, this site also aspires to Zen ideals
generally labeled [[Help:WabiSabi|WabiSabi]]. Zen finds beauty in the imperfect and
ephemeral. When it comes down to it, that's all you need.//

//The Universe tends toward chaos. The Universe tends toward Wiki.//

You can say hello on [[RecentVisitors]], or read about [[Help:HowToUseWiki|HowToUseWiki]] and
[[Help:AddingPages|AddingPages]]. Currently this Wiki has no theme for discussion, so go
ahead and play with it and have fun!!
