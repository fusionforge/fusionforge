A **~WikiWikiWeb** is a site where everyone can collaborate on the
content. The most well-known and widely used Wiki is the Portland
Pattern Repository at http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?WikiWikiWeb.

You and I will find these statements there particularly relevant:

//The point is to make the [EditText|Help:EditText] form simple and the [FindPage]
search fast.//

//In addition to being quick, this site also aspires to Zen ideals
generally labeled [WabiSabi|Help:WabiSabi]. Zen finds beauty in the imperfect and
ephemeral. When it comes down to it, that's all you need.//

//The Universe tends toward chaos. The Universe tends toward Wiki.//

You can say hello on [RecentVisitors], or read about [HowToUseWiki|Help:HowToUseWiki] and
[AddingPages|Help:AddingPages]. Currently this Wiki has no theme for discussion, so go
ahead and play with it and have fun!!
