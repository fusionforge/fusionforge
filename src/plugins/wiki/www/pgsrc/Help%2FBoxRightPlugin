The **~BoxRight** [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] displays its content as a wiki-formatted
right-floating div box with border.

== Example ==

{{{
<<BoxRight
**This Wiki** ([[Help:WikiWikiWeb|What is a Wiki?]]) is a place where problems and
solutions are being documented.

See [[Help/HowToUseWiki|How to use this Wiki]] for instructions.

//Don't be afraid - it's easy and you can't break anything!//
}}}

== Remark ==

If ENABLE_MARKUP_DIVSPAN is enabled then you can produce the same result with a simple {{{<div>}}}:
{{{
