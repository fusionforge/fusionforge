The **~RedirectTo** [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] can be used to redirect a user to another page.
In other words it makes a page an //alias// for another page.

When redirecting to another wiki page, a note is added to the top of the target
page saying  //(Redirected from SomeRedirectingPage)//.

Redirection to external URLs will only work on locked pages.

== Arguments ==

Use only one of these arguments at a time.

{| class="bordered"
|-
! Argument
! Description
! Default value
|-
| **page**
| The page to redirect to (a wiki page name).
| none
|-
| **href**
| An external URL to redirect to.  Redirection to external URLs will only work on locked pages. (If the URL contains funny characters, you'll probably have to put quotes around the URL.)
| none
|}

== Caveats ==

For most purposes, the ~RedirectToPlugin invocation makes any other content on the page inaccessible.

== Example ==

A page may be made a alias for the [[HomePage]] by using this code:
{{{
<<RedirectTo page="HomePage">>
}}}

To see the example in action, visit [[HomePageAlias]].
