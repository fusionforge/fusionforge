The **~PreferenceApp** [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] is used to analyze a category of items
that a group of people have rated.  A user is grouped to be analyzed in the group by
# having rated at least one item in the database and
# matching the optional criteria for declaring a budget on their homepage.

An example of a budget declaration would be "~TotalSoda: 50" on my homepage.

~PreferenceApp will output a matrix style table shows "how much" fractionally a group of people prefer an item over other items.  For example, if my soda
budget is 100 then ~PreferenceApp might assign 20 units of my budget to Moutain Dew.
