This simple [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] allows blog-style entries on a page. Try making a few entries, and then look at [[RecentChanges]] to get an idea of how things work.

This plugin shows 'blogs' (comments/news) associated with a
particular page and provides an input form for adding a new blog.

== Arguments ==

{| class="bordered"
|-
! Argument
! Description
! Default value
|-
| **page**
| page which is blogged to
| Current page
|-
| **order**
|
* 'normal' - place in chronological order
* 'reverse' - place in reverse chronological order
| normal
|-
| **mode**
|
* 'show' - only show old blogs
* 'add' - only show entry box for new blog
* 'show,add' - show old blogs then entry box
* 'add,show' - show entry box followed by old blogs
| show,add
|}

== Usage ==

Add {{{<<WikiBlog>>}}} at your ~PersonalPage and BlogArchives and
BlogJournal will find the Blog entries automatically.

Now it is also the base class for all attachable pagetypes:
"wikiblog", "comment" and "wikiforum"

== Hints/comments ==

To have the blog show up on a separate page:

On ~TopPage, use {{{<<WikiBlog mode=add>>}}}
Create ~TopPage/Blog with this page as actionpage:
{{{<<WikiBlog pagename=TopPage mode=show>>}}}

To have the main ADMIN_USER Blog appear under Blog and not under WikiBlog/Blog
or ~UserName/Blog as for other users blogs,
define BLOG_DEFAULT_EMPTY_PREFIX=true
use the page Blog as basepage
and user="" (as default for ADMIN or current user) and pagename="Blog"
in the various blog plugins (BlogArchives, BlogJournal)

== Example ==

<<WikiBlog>>

== Author ==
* Michael Van Dam, major refactor by [[Help:Jeff Dairiki|Jeff Dairiki]] (as ~AddComment)
* Changed as baseclass to ~AddComment and ~WikiForum and ~EditToolbar integration by [[Help:Reini Urban|Reini Urban]].
