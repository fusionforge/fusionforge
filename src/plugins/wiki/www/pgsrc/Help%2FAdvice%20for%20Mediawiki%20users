If you contribute to Wikipedia or to other wikis that use the Mediawiki
software, you will notice some differences in the wiki syntax of Mediawiki
and the wiki syntax of Phpwiki.

== Syntax differences ==

Here are some differences between Mediawiki and Phpwiki:
* Italics are ##//## (but you can also use ##''## like in Wikipedia)
* Bold is ##~*~*## (you //cannot use// ##'''## like in Wikipedia)
* Line break is ##~\~\## in Wikicreole, ##~<br />## in Mediawiki
* There is **no automatic capitalisation** of first character of page name. Pages *<samp>~[~[foo~]~]</samp>* and *<samp>~[~[Foo~]~]</samp>* are different.
* A space in a page name in not equivalent to an underscore. Pages *<samp>~[~[foo bar~]~]</samp>* and *<samp>~[~[foo_bar~]~]</samp>* are different. We recommend to use a space in the page names.
* Many things that are built-in in Mediawiki use plug-ins in Phpwiki (table of contents, redirections, back links, etc.).
* Redirections are less sophisticated in Phpwiki (e.g. backlinks do not show redirected pages)

== Tables ==

You can use in ACOS Forge the [[Help:MediawikiTablePlugin|Mediawiki table syntax]].
