**Categories** are a way to group pages that are related to the same subject.
They provide an easy way to browse the wiki.

In Phpwiki, categories are not stored in a separate namespace like in Mediawiki for
instance. A category is a page with a name that begins with "Category" and contains
a call the the [[Help:BackLinksPlugin|BackLinks plugin]].

== Creating a new category ==

The simplest way to create a new category is to to go the
[[:CategoryCategory|CategoryCategory]] page.

Enter its name (starting with "Category") and hit "CreatePage" button.

This will automatically insert the necessary plugins calls.

You might want to add at the beginning of the page a paragraph
explaining the purpose of the category.

Suppose you want to create a category called **~CategoryFruit**.
You might add:
{{{
This Category groups the different kinds of fruit.
}}}

By default, the new category is created as a subcategory of
[[:CategoryCategory|CategoryCategory]] (the "root" category).
You might want to change this (see below "Category hierarchies").

== Putting a page in a category ==

To put the article **banana** in ~CategoryFruit, you have to put at the end of the page:

{{{
----
[[CategoryFruit]]
}}}

The ~CategoryFruit page will then display your text describing the
purpose of the category, then the list of pages in the category.

The can be done very easily by using the {{/themes/default/images/ed_category.png|[C]}}
button of the edit toolbar when editing the page.

== Category hierarchies ==

The simplest way to use categories is to use "flat" categories. But you
can also build a hierarchy of categories by putting categories themselves
in categories.

For example, you can put the {{{[[CategoryFruit]]}}} in {{{[[CategoryFood]]}}}
instead of default {{{[[CategoryCategory]]}}}.

== Tips and tricks ==

* Page [[:CategoryCategory]] is the root category. All categories should be subcategories of this category (recursively).
* If in a page you need to refer to a category, you should add a semi-colon: {{{[[:CategoryFruit]]}}}. This will create a link to the category //without// putting the page in the category (which would be the case if using {{{[[CategoryFruit]]}}}).
* You can put a page in several categories if needed.
