The *Transclude* [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] can be used to embed include whole (external) web pages within a wiki page.

== Arguments

{| class="bordered"
|-
! Argument
! Description
! Default value
|-
| src
| The URL of the page to transclude
| ''none''
|-
| title
| The title of the page to transclude
| ''Transcluded page''
|-
| height
| The (initial) height of the transclusion frame. If, possible, after the transcluded page is loaded, the frame is resized via Javascript so that it fits the entire transcluded page. (See below for more.)
| 450
|-
| quiet
| If set, frame appears as normal content
| false 
|}

== Bugs / Caveats

o Pages are transcluded using =<iframe>= tags.  Older browsers do not
  support ''iframe''s.  In that case the user will be presented with a
  link to the transcluded material.

o When possible, Javascript code is used to adjust the height of the
  _iframe_ so that it fits the entire transcluded page.
  Unfortunately, this seems possible only when the transcluded page
  comes from the same server as the wiki page.  (This restriction is
  due to security checks built in to the Javascript language.)

o The recursion detection code does not currently work.  Be careful to
  avoid recursive transclusions, or you'll be sorry (or at least
  amused.)

== Example

<verbatim>
<?plugin Transclude src="http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/demo/ChangeLog" ?>
</verbatim>

will get you

<?plugin Transclude src="http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/demo/ChangeLog" ?>
