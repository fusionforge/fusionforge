RateIt: A recommender system, based on [[http://www.movielens.org/|MovieLens]] and "suggest".

Store user ratings per pagename. The wikilens theme displays a navbar image bar
with some nice Javascript magic and this plugin shows various recommendations.

There should be two methods to store ratings:
* In a SQL database as in wikilens [[http://dickens.cs.umn.edu/dfrankow/wikilens]]

The most important fact: A page has more than one rating. There can
be (and will be!) many ratings per page (ratee): different raters
(users), in different dimensions. Are those stored per page
(ratee)? Then what if I wish to access the ratings per rater
(user)?

Wikilens plans several user-centered applications like:
* a) show my ratings
* b) show my buddies' ratings
* c) show how my ratings are like my buddies'
* d) show where I agree/disagree with my buddy
* e) show what this group of people agree/disagree on

If the ratings are stored in a real DB in a table, we can index the
ratings by rater and ratee, and be confident in
performance. Currently [[http://www.movielens.org/|MovieLens]] has 80,000 users, 7,000 items,
10,000,000 ratings. This is an average of 1400 ratings/page if each
page were rated equally. However, they're not: the most popular
things have tens of thousands of ratings (e.g., "Pulp Fiction" has
42,000 ratings). If ratings are stored per page, you would have to
save/read huge page metadata every time someone submits a
rating. Finally, the movie domain has an unusually small number of
items-- I'd expect a lot more in music, for example.

For a simple rating system one can also store the rating in the page
metadata (default).

Recommender Engines:
* Recommendation/Prediction is a special field of "Data Mining"
* For a list of (also free) software see http://www.the-data-mine.com/bin/view/Software/WebIndex
** movielens: (Java Server) will be gpl'd in summer 2004 (weighted)
** suggest: is free for non-commercial use, available as compiled library (non-weighted)
** Autoclass: simple public domain C library
