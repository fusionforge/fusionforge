The **~UpLoad** [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] displays an editbox and two buttons.
* The first button lets you choose the file to be uploaded at your local filesystem. The text value of this button is localised from your browser.
* The second “Upload” button actually uploads the given filename to the upload directory.
This directory is not browsable, any file there may be accessed by using the “Upload~:”
[[InterWikiMap]] prefix to the given filename. This way you can easily inline uploaded images.

# The user must be authenticated to be able to upload.
# The filename may not end with certain disallowed extensions, to prevent from abuse.

# Already existing uploaded files are NOT overwritten.
