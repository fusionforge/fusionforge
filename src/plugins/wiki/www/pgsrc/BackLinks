The contents of all pages are searched to find links to the current
page. The ~BackLinks function also answers the question: "Which pages
contain the title of this page?".

----

<<BackLinks exclude||='' include_self||=1 noheader||=0>>

----

To display the list of pages which all contain multiple links use a pagelist as page argument.
For example {{{<<BackLinks page=Milk,Honey>>}}} would display all pages which 
contain links to Milk AND Honey.
