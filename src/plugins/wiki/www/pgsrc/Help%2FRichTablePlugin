The **~RichTable** [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] is a plugin that takes off from the [[Help:OldStyleTablePlugin|OldStyleTable]] plugin. It allows a user to specify arbitrary properties of ##<table>##, ##<tr>## and ##<td>## with a very simple markup.

This plugin is included for legacy only. We recommand to
use [[Help:MediawikiTablePlugin|Mediawiki tables]] instead.

== Syntax ==

The contents of each cell are individually processed by the ~BlockParser. This means that you can do interesting things like put **invoke plugins**, use **enumerated lists** etc within each cell!

* A ##"-"## (dash) at the start of a new line represents a new row in the table.
* A ##"|"## (vertical bar or pipe) at the start of a new line represents a cell.
* Attributes for the tags
** A line that starts with a ##"*"## (star or asterisk) after a ##"|"## is parsed for attributes for the corresponding cell.
** Attributes for the table are given on line that starts with a ##"*"##, only if the line appears before any other line except whitespace.
** A line that starts with a ##-## is always parsed for attributes since it can't have any content, unlike a cell.
* Cell contents
** Cell contents are processed by the ~BlockParser.
** Any line that starts with a ##"*"## anywhere other than the table attribute line is treated as normal content.
** Any line that starts with whitespace is also treated as content.
** Any cell line that does not have a ##"*"## after the ##"|"## is treated as normal content.
** All content lines that follow a cell line are added to that cell. They can contain arbitrary text except the above cases.
** If there is no cell in the current row, content lines are dropped silently.
* The two special characters ##"~~"## and ##"?>"## should be escaped as ##"\~~"## and ##"?\>"##. I havn't discovered any other characters yet that might need to be escaped. This is required for the block parser to work.

We allow attributes with or without quotes (")
{{{
border=1, cellpadding="5"
style="font-family: sans-serif; border-top:1px solid #dddddd;"
style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
}}}

== Example ==

<<RichTable

*border=1, cellpadding=5, bgcolor=#f0f8f8, width=75%, align=center
-
|* colspan=3, align=center
HomePage
-
|* colspan=2
[http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/demo/themes/default/images/png.png]
|* rowspan=2
This cell actually has a plugin invocation inside it!
<?plugin
BackLinks
?\>
- bgcolor=white
|
# One
# Two
|
* Foo
* Bar
- bgcolor=cyan
This line gets dropped ... no cell to contain it!
|* bgcolor=#f0f0ff, align=center
One paragraph

Another paragraph?
|* align=left
This cell uses the row color
| I wish this cell had a nested table inside it! :(
>>

The above table is rendered from:

== Known Bugs ==
* The plugin can't nest itself yet. Thus nested tables are currently not possible.
