<<Comment
  Required actionpage for blogs. You can override a user base here.
  The default is the current username.
  If user=ADMIN_USER and BLOG_DEFAULT_EMPTY_PREFIX=true then the base will be /Blog.

  The most beautiful is copying this page to a new page Blog and have your admin blogs under /Blog only.
  See the blog theme.
