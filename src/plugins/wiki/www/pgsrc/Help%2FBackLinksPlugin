The **~BackLinks** [[Help:WikiPlugin|plugin]] lists all pages which link to a given page.

The contents of all pages are searched to find links to the current
page. The ~BackLinks function also answers the question: “Which pages
contain the title of this page?”.

To display the list of pages which all contain multiple links use a pagelist as page argument.
For example {{{<<BackLinks page=Milk,Honey>>}}} would display all pages which
contain links to Milk AND Honey.

== Usage ==

{{{
<<BackLinks arguments>>
}}}

== Arguments ==

All [[Help:PageList|PageList]] arguments, plus the following ones:

{| class="bordered"
|-
! Argument
! Description
! Default value
|-
| **page**
| Page from which the back links are calculated.
| Current page
|-
| **include_self**
| Boolean. If true, include yourself in the results.
| false
|-
| **noheader**
| Boolean. If true, do not display header.
| false
|-
| **linkmore**
| If count > 0 and limit > 0 display a link with the number of all results, linked to the given pagename.
|
|}

== Example ==

{{{
<<BackLinks page=HomePage>>
}}}

<<BackLinks page=HomePage>>

== Known Problems ==

Back links should be found even if the link is inside a table, or in an
included template, but not in some complex cases (for example, the link
is in a template included inside a table).
