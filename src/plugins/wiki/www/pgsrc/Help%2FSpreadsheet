Phpwiki has extented the [[Help:Wikicreole|Wikicreole]] syntax of tables so that some simple
spreadsheet-like calculations can be performed in tables.

== Syntax ==

Five functions are available: SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN and COUNT.

They operate on the current row (R) or column (C).

The function is placed in the cell surrounded by ##@@##.
Other wiki text can be placed in the cell, but there can be only one formula per cell.

Total of both colums and rows is calculated automatically by wiki.

== Limitations ==

The formulas are evaluated line per line, from left to right.

So this will work:

{{{
|          10 |         -13 | @@=SUM(R)@@ |
|          15 |          17 | @@=SUM(R)@@ |
| @@=SUM(C)@@ | @@=SUM(C)@@ | @@=SUM(R)@@ |
}}}

|          10 |         -13 | @@=SUM(R)@@ |
|          15 |          17 | @@=SUM(R)@@ |
| @@=SUM(C)@@ | @@=SUM(C)@@ | @@=SUM(R)@@ |

And this will not:

{{{
| @@=SUM(R)@@ |          10 |         -13 |
| @@=SUM(R)@@ |          15 |          17 |
| @@=SUM(R)@@ | @@=SUM(C)@@ | @@=SUM(C)@@ |
}}}

| @@=SUM(R)@@ |          10 |         -13 |
| @@=SUM(R)@@ |          15 |          17 |
| @@=SUM(R)@@ | @@=SUM(C)@@ | @@=SUM(C)@@ |
