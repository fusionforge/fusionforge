These are here mostly for debugging purposes (at least, that is the hope.)

In normal use, you should not need to use these, though, then again,
they should not really do any harm.

!!! Purge Markup Cache

(If your wiki is so configured,) the transformed (almost-HTML) content
of the most recent version of each page is cached. This speeds up page
rendering since parsing of the wiki-text takes a fair amount of juice.

Hitting this button will delete all cached transformed
content. (Each pages content will be transformed and re-cached next
time someone views it.)

<?plugin WikiAdminUtils
         action=purge-cache
         label="Purge Markup Cache"
?>

!!! Clean Wiki Database of Illegal Filenames

Page names beginning with the subpage-separator, usually a slash
(=/=), are not allowed. Sometimes though an errant plugin or something
might create one....

This button will delete any pages with illegal page names, without possibility to restore.

<?plugin WikiAdminUtils
         action=purge-bad-pagenames
         label="Purge bad pagenames"
?>

!!! Clean Wiki Database of empty and unreferenced pages

<b>Warning!</b> This button will delete every empty and unreferenced page, without any possibility to restore them again.
This will disable the possibility to revert or get back any deleted page.

<?plugin WikiAdminUtils
         action=purge-empty-pages
         label="Purge all empty unreferenced pages"
?>

!!! Convert cached_html to new SQL column

This is only needed on SQL or ADODB if you didn't do action=upgrade, but created the
new page.cached_html field seperately, and now you want to move this data from
page.pagedata over to page.cached_html.

<?plugin WikiAdminUtils
         action=convert-cached-html
         label="Convert cached_html"
?>

!!! Check Wiki Database

This button will check the Wiki page database for consistency. This can last several minutes.

<?plugin WikiAdminUtils
         action=db-check
         label="Check Wiki Database"
?>

!!! Rebuild Wiki Database

This will retransform all pages and rebuild the Wiki database on consistency errors or parser updates.
This can last several minutes, eat a lot of memory and possibly times out!!

<?plugin WikiAdminUtils
         action=db-rebuild
         label="Rebuild Wiki Database"
?>
