Does not work in Wikicreole syntax
<!-- <<IncludePage page=Help/AllPagesPlugin sections=2>> -->

== Known bugs ===

* Line and word limit doesn't work if the included page itself includes a plugin.
* "sections" parameter does not work if sections to include are in Wikicreole syntax.
* "section" parameter does not always work if sections to include use both Wikicreole/Mediawiki and classic Phpwiki syntax.
