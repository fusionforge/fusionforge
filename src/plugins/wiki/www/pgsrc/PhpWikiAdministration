_*Note:*_  _Most of the actions on this page require administrative privileges._

<?plugin CreateToc jshide||=0 with_toclink||=1 position=right with_counter=1 ?>

== Page Explorer

First select pages and then define the action:

<?plugin-form WikiAdminSelect s="*" ?>

or call the available ~WikiAdmin actions directly:

[/Remove] |
  [/Rename] |
    [/Replace] |
      [/SetAcl] |
        [/Chown]

== User Management

=== Reset a users password

<?plugin-form PasswordReset textinput=user method=post ?>

=== Email Verification

This is currently non-strict, leaving some possible holes in not being able to
connect to certain mail hosts, which can be overridden below. See [PhpWiki:EmailVerification].

This button will show a list of all users with registered emails and buttons to set the verification status manually.

<?plugin WikiAdminUtils
         action=email-verification
         label="Email Verification"
?>

=== Access Restrictions (disabled)

To prevent from robots eating all possible ressources in a short time, blocking from certain IPs
or not-well-behaving user agents can be defined below. See [PhpWiki:HowToBlockRobots] and
[MeatBall:SurgeProtector]. _Note: Not yet enabled._

<?plugin WikiAdminUtils
         action=access-restrictions
         label="Access Restrictions"
?>

== Cleanup

A Wiki SandBox is very easy to clean. Here you can restore it to
pristine condition by loading the default from pgsrc.

[Rake the SandBox|phpwiki:?action=loadfile&source=pgsrc/SandBox].

== Making Snapshots or Backups

=== ZIP files of database

These links lead to zip files, generated on the fly, which contain all
the pages in your Wiki. The zip file will be downloaded to your local
computer.

This *[ZIP Snapshot | phpwiki:?action=zip]* contains only the
latest versions of each page, while this *[ZIP Dump | phpwiki:?action=zip&include=all]* contains all archived versions.

(If the [PhpWiki|PhpWiki:PhpWiki] is configured to allow it, anyone can download a zip file.)

If your php has _zlib_ support, the files in the archive will be compressed, otherwise they will just be stored.

=== Dump to directory

Here you can dump pages of your Wiki into a directory of your choice.

<?plugin WikiForm action=dumpserial?>

The most recent version of each page will written out to the directory, one page per file. Your server must have write permissions to the directory!

== Restoring

If you have dumped a set of pages from [PhpWiki|PhpWiki:PhpWiki], you can reload them
here. Note that pages in your database will be overwritten; thus, if
you dumped your HomePage when you load it from this form it will
overwrite the one in your database now. If you want to be selective
just delete the pages from the directory (or zip file) which you don't
want to load.

=== Upload File

Here you can upload ZIP archives, or individual files from your
(client) machine.

<?plugin WikiForm action=upload?>

=== Load File

Here you can load ZIP archives, individual files or entire
directories. The file or directory must be local to the http
server. You can also use this form to load from an http: or ftp: URL.

<?plugin WikiForm action=loadfile?>
<?plugin WikiForm action=loadfile buttontext="Load & Overwrite" overwrite=1?>

=== Upgrade

Do some verification checks and upgrade changes automatically, after having installed a
new phpwiki engine update:
* Upgrade new or changed page revisions from pgsrc,
* Upgrade the database schema (mysql _page.id auto_increment_, ADD _session.sess_ip_),

[ Upgrade | phpwiki:HomePage?action=upgrade ]

== Format of the files

=== Current Format

Currently the pages are stored, one per file, as MIME (RFC:2045)
e-mail (RFC:822) messages. The content-type _application/x-phpwiki_
is used, and page meta-data is encoded in the content-type
parameters. (If the file contains several versions of a page, it will
have type _multipart/mixed_, and contain several sub-parts, each
with type _application/x-phpwiki_.)  The message body contains the
page text.

=== Old Formats

==== Serialized Files

The dump to directory command used to dump the pages as PHP
_serialized()_ strings. For humans, this made the files very hard
to read, and nearly impossible to edit.

==== Plain Files

Before that the page text was just dumped to a file--this means that
all page meta-data was lost. Note that when loading _plain files_,
the page name is deduced from the file name.

The upload and load functions will automatically recognize each of
these three types of files, and handle them accordingly.

== Dump pages as XHTML

<?plugin WikiForm action=dumphtml?>

This will generate a directory of static pages suitable for
distribution on disk where no web server is available. The various
links for page editing functions and navigation are removed from the
pages.

The XHTML file collection can also be downloaded as an *[XHTML ZIP Snapshot | phpwiki:?action=ziphtml]*.
