fusionforge-plugin-authcas
--------------------------

This is the external CAS authentication plugin for FusionForge.

Installation:

- files from include/ go to /usr/share/gforge/plugins/authcas/include/
- files from www/ go to /usr/share/gforge/www/plugins/authcas/

Setup:

- customise /etc/fusionforge/config.ini.d/authcas.ini to match your
LDAP installation (server, base DN, and mapping)
- /usr/share/gforge/bin/register-plugin authcas "CAS external
authentication"

Voil√†, you can now log into FusionForge with your existing CAS
session.  Your account will be created the first time you log in
(which means you can't add someone to a group before his/her first
login).
