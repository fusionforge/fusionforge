ADMS.SW plugin

This plugin will provide content-negociation means to export RDF+XML
ADMS.SW profiles for projects on /projects URLs, in addition to the
content already provided by the 'doaprdf' plugin.

ADMS.SW stands for "Asset Description Metadata Schema for
Software". See https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/adms_foss/description
for more details.

For instance, one may try :
 curl -k -H 'Accept: application/rdf+xml' https://myforge.example.com/projects/aproject/

The 'doaprdf' plugin has to be installed.

Since V XXX this plugin also supports the ADMS Application Profile for
Joinup (see
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/adms/asset_release/adms-application-profile-joinup)
