"""Handle passwords and sanitize approved messages."""

# There are current 5 roles defined in Mailman, as codified in Defaults.py:
# user, list-creator, list-moderator, list-admin, site-admin.
#
# Here's how we do cookie based authentication.
#
# Each role (see above) has an associated password, which is currently the
# only way to authenticate a role (in the future, we'll authenticate a
# user and assign users to roles).
#
# Each cookie has the following ingredients: the authorization context's
# secret (i.e. the password, and a timestamp.  We generate an SHA1 hex
# digest of these ingredients, which we call the `mac'.  We then marshal
# up a tuple of the timestamp and the mac, hexlify that and return that as
# a cookie keyed off the authcontext.  Note that authenticating the user
# also requires the user's email address to be included in the cookie.
#
# The verification process is done in CheckCookie() below.  It extracts
# the cookie, unhexlifies and unmarshals the tuple, extracting the
# timestamp.  Using this, and the shared secret, the mac is calculated,
# and it must match the mac passed in the cookie.  If so, they're golden,
# otherwise, access is denied.
#
# It is still possible for an adversary to attempt to brute force crack
# the password if they obtain the cookie, since they can extract the
# timestamp and create macs based on password guesses.  They never get a
# cleartext version of the password though, so security rests on the
# difficulty and expense of retrying the cgi dialog for each attempt.  It
# also relies on the security of SHA1.
