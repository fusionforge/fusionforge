This git repository took out the contributed post-receive hook
from git.git with its full history and aims to continue to fix
and develop it. There is also FusionForge/Evolvis integration,
in a separate branch. (For some strange reason FusionForge has
opted out of the integration and uses the standalone version.)

This repository is hosted on evolvis.org (a public FusionForge
instance by tarent). We mirror it on github for popularity, as
shown below. Development of the hook is partially sponsored by
tarent, FreeWRT (now The MirOS Project), Teckids, FusionForge.

• https://evolvis.org/plugins/scmgit/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=evolvis-platfrm/recvhook.git
• https://github.com/mirabilos/recvhook

Please do steer new contributions to Evolvis. Development will
be done in the “standalone” branch which can then be merged to
both “master” (for visibility) and “forge” (further integrati‐
ve and development work). Ensure the live branches and release
tags always only have the hook script (not this README file or
the LICENCE file) in them, since other repositories merge them
using the subtree strategy regularily.

This script is basically a replacement for the script
that came with git, except you will not see the annoying
“[SCM] ” præfix in eMails any more, and have to change
a few configuration settings:

• hooks.showrev ⇒ clear this, use our default
• hooks.diffopts ⇒ clear this, use our default

There are notable new settings:

• hooks.replyto (sets a Reply-To: header)
• hooks.shortdesc (used in the Subject: header instead
  of the content of the description file)
• hooks.kgbconffile (full path to a configuration file
  for kgb-client, triggers on-push IRC notifications)
• hooks.curltrigger (whitespace-separated list of URIs
  to trigger, with cURL, on each push)

There’s also noticeable effort to fix umlauts and
other nōn-ASCII characters in eMails – as long as
you use UTF-8 in your commits, of course.

For more information, please read the script directly.
If there will ever be frequently asked questions, I’ll
amend this documentation section though ☺
