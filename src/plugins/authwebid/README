fusionforge-plugin-authwebid
-----------------------------

This is meant to be the external WebID authentication plugin for FusionForge.

It allows the forge to delegate authentication to a third party WebID "Identity Provider" 
which will check the validity of the WebID profile of the user (checking that 
the SSL cert used to access the IdP is the same as the one mentioned in the 
FOAF profile it points to).
That IdP must be trusted by the forge administrators to do so, of course. 

If the plugin is activated by a user in its account management page, then 
he/she may login to FusionForge using WebID (provided that the plugin is 
activated on the whole site/forge, of course).

Any number of WebID identities (URLs) can be used by a forge user to authenticate.

Only one user may use one particular WebID identity simultaneously.

WebID identities must have been added through the account management's WebID tab, 
and are associated to the user, provided he/she owns them (i.e. can successfully 
log-in to these URLs).

The logged-in session is granted full privileges of the user, for now. 
This should be improved in a later version, as WebID may not be trusted for critical 
operations on the forge.

The code depends on the WebIDDelegatedAuth library : https://github.com/WebIDauth/WebIDDelegatedAuth (a scaled down version of libAuthentication).

This plugin's code is distributed under the conditions of the GNU GPL v2+ license.
  

USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISKS : THIS IS JUST A VERY EARLY PLUGIN, AND NO SECURITY AUDIT WAS CONDUCTED !
