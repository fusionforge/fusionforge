Currently the plugin is in development and many fields need to be experimented with, so do not trust the code to be fuctional at all times.

	$fusionforge/plugins -> $source/src/plugins/importexport/
	$fusionforge/www/plugins/ -> $source/src/plugins/importexport
	$fusionforge/common/ -> $source/src/plugins/importexport/common/
	$fusionforge/etc/ -> $source/src/plugins/importexport/etc
