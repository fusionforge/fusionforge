Git repositories can be available thru http dav protocol.
To setup git thru dav, here are some steps you need to follow :
1) set use_dav to yes and set use_ssh to no in scmgit.ini
2) set httpd_reload_cmd in scmgit.ini according to your linux distribution
3) copy the httpd.conf.d/plugin-scmgit-dav.inc in your httpd config directory
4) configure the httpd.conf.d/plugin-scmgit-dav.inc according to your installation
5) restart httpd
6) the cronjob should do the job now when you add new repository
