Globalactivity plugin

This plugin provides a forge-wide view into the activities of all
projects (modulo permissions).  It can be seen as an aggregate of all
the project-wide "activity" pages.

The relevant data is also made available through a SOAP API.

The method is called globalactivity_getActivity.  It takes four
parameters:

- a session token (as for the rest of the SOAP API): string (as
  returned from the login method), possibly empty if the API is to be
  used anonymously;

- a start date: integer (Unix timestamp: number of seconds since
  1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC);

- an end date: integer (ditto);

- a list of sections for which to list events (array of strings), to
  be picked among: scmsvn, svngit, svnhg, trackeropen, trackerclose,
  frsrelease, forumpost, news, taskopen, taskclose, taskdelete,
  docmannew, docmanupdate, docgroupnew.  An empty list means no
  filtering.

The return value is an array of GlobalActivityEntry; a
GlobalActivityEntry is a hash with the following keys: group_id
(identifier for the project on the forge), section (see above, with a
quirk: scmsvn, scmgit and scmhg all end up in the same "scm" section),
ref_id (meaning differs across sections), subref_id (ditto),
description (title, commit number, or otherwise descriptive text),
activity_date (as a Unix timestamp).
