CompactPreview plugin

Provides OSLC-compatible compact preview of recources such as users and projects.

Whenever activated, a JavaScript popup will appear when mouse moves over links to user or project profiles, containing a minimal identity card for these.

The code originally existed in the oslc plugin, but was committed in a separate plugin so as not to force users to activate the REST web services for the trackers if they don't want to.

This plugin was initially developped as part of the COCLICO project with financial support from Region Ile de France.
