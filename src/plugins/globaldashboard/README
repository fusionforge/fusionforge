GlobalDashboard plugin.

This is a fusionforge plugin for discovery and browsing between projects hosted
in different software forges.
It is a dashboard that contain several graphical widgets that allows users to 
discover and display different software forge's artifacts they are interested 
in such as:
- Projects information
- Tracker artifacts
- Tracker artifacts update
- Releases information
- Monitored Spaces (like Forums, trackers, etc.)
- Source code commits
- and others

Those information are retrieved from physically different software forges
on which the user is registered with the same identity.

Quick display techniques like compact previews will also ease information
display. 

Data like tracker artifacts are gathered from other forges sites using 
OSLC-CM protocol if the forges are already OSLC compliant.

This plugin is part of fusionforge and is a completely free software product
according to the terms of the GPL2 License.
