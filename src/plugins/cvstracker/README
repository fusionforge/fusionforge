1. Installation Instructions
----------------------------

Decompress the plugin tarball and place it into your plugins directory. 
Usually, this would be in a location like /opt/gforge/gforge/plugins/cvstracker
Whereever you place it, be sure your /etc/gforge/local.inc file has 
$sys_plugins_path pointing to the plugins directory.

The cvstracker/etc/plugins/cvstracker/config.php should be copied and edited 
to 

	/etc/gforge/plugins/cvstracker/config.php

The 'Site Admin' tab on the GForge web interface now has a 'Plugin Manager' 
page where you can activate plugins on a sitewide basis. Be sure to do that
if you want this plugin to be available to projects.


2. Description
--------------

CVSTracker plugin allows linking CVS Log messages to Trackers and Tasks.
It will review all commits in a project and search for a specific string
to know which task or tracker is related. 

This string is on the form: [#NNN] for Tracker, and [TNNN] for Tasks.
Example:

$ cvs ci README -m "This patch will solve a problem on Bug [#123] and closes
task [T344]."

Then, in the task or tracker detail page, it will appear that logs with links
to the involved files.

3. Use
------

You have to enable CVSTracker Plugin for the project you want to use it. You 
can change enabled/disabled checkbox in Project -> Admin -> Edit Public Info.
You'll see a checkbox near the bottom saying: "Use Cvs 2 Tracker Plugin". 
Enable it, and wait for cronfiles to be executed.

Once it's active, you can use cvs log message to attach commit info to related
tasks and trackers.

You can see those Logs in the detail page of trackers and tasks.
