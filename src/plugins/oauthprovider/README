Implementation of an OAuth provider for FusionForge.

Depends on OAuth PHP library (http://code.google.com/p/oauth/source/browse/#svn%2Fcode%2Fphp) as of rev. 622
(packaged in Debian in liboauth-php package).

To test the OAuth plugin, you may use the 'command-line.php' provided script :

1. Create a consumer in FF : this will generate a key and secret that you'll need to pass to command-line.php 
(for instance, let's assume that you get 2a879dc112593828254c5127381d1b9a and 6cd7286abbdd0740c6fdfefcae3c8ec2, 
that we'll use in the example runs below) :

2. Generate a request token for that consumer (assuming that the forge runs on https://192.168.122.90) :

 $ php example/command-line.php request_token 2a879dc112593828254c5127381d1b9a 6cd7286abbdd0740c6fdfefcae3c8ec2
 
You'll get :

 received request token :
  $oauth_token : 2a38e3972926eb155514
  $oauth_token_secret : 0920d9d074892dc96697

 Go to the following URL in your FusionForge session to authorize the request token:
  https://192.168.122.90/plugins/oauthprovider/authorize.php?oauth_token=2a38e3972926eb155514

 Upon completion, you will be able request access tokens with the authorized token.

3. Follow the provided instructions to access the authorization dialog (here by browsing 
https://192.168.122.90/plugins/oauthprovider/authorize.php?oauth_token=2a38e3972926eb155514 with a valid 
FusionForge session) where you'll be prompted for a role to grant to the consumer for that request token.

4. Once you've authorized it, you may use your consumer and your request token's keys and secrets, to request 
an access token :
 
 $ php example/command-line.php access_token 2a879dc112593828254c5127381d1b9a 6cd7286abbdd0740c6fdfefcae3c8ec2 2a38e3972926eb155514 0920d9d074892dc96697
 
5. Hopefully, you'll get an access token :

 received access token :
  $oauth_token : 471cd074f441556f70bc
  $oauth_token_secret : 72a2fa4d05b5b9c47c3a

6. You may now use this access token to access FusionForge scripts.
