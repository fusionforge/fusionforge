fusionforge-plugin-authopenid
-----------------------------

This is meant to be the external OpenID authentication plugin for FusionForge.

If the plugin is activated by a user in its account management page, then 
he/she may login to FusionForge using OpenID (provided that the plugin is 
activated on the whole site/forge, of course).

Any number of OpenID identities (URLs) can be used by a forg user to authenticate.

Only one user may use an OpenID identity simultaneously.

OpenID identities must have been added through the account management's OpenID tab, 
and are associated to the user, provided he/she owns them (i.e. can successfully 
log-in to these URLs).

The logged-in session is granted full privileges of the user, for now. 
This should be improved in a later version, as OpenID may not be trusted for critical 
operations on the forge.

The code depends on the lightopenid library (http://code.google.com/p/lightopenid/)

USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISKS : THIS IS JUST A VERY EARLY PLUGIN, AND NO SECURITY AUDIT WAS CONDUCTED !
