extsubproj plugin : manages external subprojects on remote forges

For the moment, manages URLs that can be displayed in a widget in the project home page.

TODO : provide compact-preview of the remote projects

Note : may be interfaced with extratabs to provide each sub-project with its own tab, in mostly empty super projects otherwise

This project was implemented in the frame of the COCLICO project as a POC of distributed forges (WP2).
