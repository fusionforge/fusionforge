ForumML

ForumML is a contraction of "Forum - Mailing List".
The goal of the plugin is to add forum-like behaviors to mailing lists.

ForumML is a plugin that adds a web interface to mailing list archives.
It makes it easier to browse and search mailing lists.
It also provides a way to post to a list from the web interface.
In this case, Codendi uses your login email adress to post to the list.
The actual acceptance/distribution/archival of the message still 
depends on mailman configuration.
