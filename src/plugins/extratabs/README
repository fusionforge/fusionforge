This plugin adds a new page "Extra tabs" in the "group admin"
page. There you can create new tabs that will appear on all project
pages.

The purpose is to let people point to external resources related to
the project. For example, a project might use an external bugzilla and
they want to point people there.

The administrators of projects can now add such links. They must
simply give an URL and a name.
