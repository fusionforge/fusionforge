fusionforge-plugin-authhttpd
----------------------------

This is the external HTTPD authentication plugin for FusionForge.

Installation:

- files from include/ go to @PLUGIN_PATH@/authhttpd/include/
- files from www/ go to @SOURCE_PATH@/www/plugins/authhttpd/

Setup:

- customise @CONFIG_PATH@/config.ini.d/authhttpd.ini to match your
LDAP installation (server, base DN, and mapping)
- @BINARY_PATH@/register-plugin authhttpd "HTTPD external
authentication"

Voilà, FusionForge now reuses your existing HTTPD authentication
(Basic or otherwise).  Your account will be created the first time you
log in (which means you can't add someone to a group before his/her
first login).
