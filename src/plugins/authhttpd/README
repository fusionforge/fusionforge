fusionforge-plugin-authhttpd
----------------------------

This is the external HTTPD authentication plugin for FusionForge.

Installation:

- files from include/ go to /usr/share/gforge/plugins/authhttpd/include/
- files from www/ go to /usr/share/gforge/www/plugins/authhttpd/

Setup:

- customise /etc/fusionforge/config.ini.d/authhttpd.ini to match your
LDAP installation (server, base DN, and mapping)
- /usr/share/gforge/bin/register-plugin authhttpd "HTTPD external
authentication"

Voil√†, FusionForge now reuses your existing HTTPD authentication
(Basic or otherwise).  Your account will be created the first time you
log in (which means you can't add someone to a group before his/her
first login).
