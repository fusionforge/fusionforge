fusionforge-plugin-scmsvn
--------------------

This is the Subversion plugin for FusionForge. It creates Subversion
repositories and provides some functionality to manage them.

Decompress the plugin tarball and place it into your plugins directory.
Usually, this would be in a location like /opt/fusionforge/src/plugins/scmsvn
Whereever you place it, be sure your /etc/fusionforge/config.ini file has
plugins_path pointing to the plugins directory.

The scmsvn/etc/scmsvn.ini should be copied and edited
to

        /etc/fusionforge/config.ini.d/scmsvn.ini

The 'Site Admin' tab on the FusionForge web interface now has a 'Plugin Manager'
page where you can activate plugins on a sitewide basis. Be sure to do that
if you want this plugin to be available to projects.
