// - SVN allows automatically relocating the working copy but is VERY picky:
//   - doesn't automatically relocate on temporary redirects (302), only permanent (301)
//   - doesn't automatically relocate if there are more than 2 redirects
//   - doesn't automatically relocate if the redirect is on PROPFIND (2nd request), only on OPTIONS (1st request)

// Don't try to connect to the DB, just redirecting SVN URL
