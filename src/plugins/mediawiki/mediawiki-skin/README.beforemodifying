The FusionForge.php and fusionforge/main.css are built
from MonoBook.php and monobook/main.css mediawiki files
2 things are done

-Renaming monobook in fusionforge and MonoBook in FusionForge
-Apply a minimal patch on the renamed patch

It is highly recommended to touch these files as few as possible
so mediawiki upgrade doesn't require too much update.
Please don't apply mediawiki related bugs, rather provide the 
patch to mediawiki developpers
