fusionforge-plugin-authldap
------------------------------

This is the external LDAP authentication plugin for FusionForge.

Installation:

- files from include/ go to @PLUGIN_PATH@/authldap/include/
- files from www/ go to @SOURCE_PATH@/www/plugins/authldap/

Setup:

- customise @CONFIG_PATH@/config.ini.d/authldap.ini to match your
LDAP installation (server, base DN, and mapping)
- @BINARY_PATH@/register-plugin authldap "LDAP external
authentication"

Voilà, you can now log into FusionForge with your existing loginname
and password.  Your account will be created the first time you log in
(which means you can't add someone to a group before his/her first
login).
