@FORGENAME@ for Debian
======================

@FORGENAME@ is packaged for Debian, and was formerly packaged under
the 'gforge' source package name. Even though a transition is in
progress towards renaming it widely, only high-level meta-packages are
named with the '@PACKAGE@' prefix. The rest of the packages are
still named with the 'gforge-' prefix, so expect most paths and
filenames to still be named in relation to 'gforge'.

Status
------
Want to know what the status of this package is? Read
/usr/share/doc/@PACKAGE@/TODO.Debian or (even better)
<https://fusionforge.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fusionforge/index.php/Roadmap>.
If you miss a feature, or find a bug, or want to help, don't hesitate
to contact me (Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>) .  Plenty of features
are missing, I'm working on some, but if you don't tell me which ones
you miss the most I might process them in the wrong order for you.

  Please read the bug reports on the Debian bug-tracking system (at
<URL:http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=@PACKAGE@>)
before submitting new ones.  Be warned that bug reports describing a
problem precisely and/or offering a solution will probably be
processed faster :-)


Note on documentation
---------------------
See contents of /usr/share/doc/@OLDPACKAGE@-common/ first.

Although a few documentation files from upstream are included, they
are either very out of date or practically useless.  I mostly include
them for completeness's sake (and per request, too).  The files I'm
referring to are Install_Guide.html, Adminstration_Guide.html,
Contributor_Guide.html, INSTALL, and AUTHORS.


Installation notes
------------------
  @FORGENAME@ is a big piece of software.  It's far-reaching.  It
fiddles with many different parts of the system.  As automated as I
have tried to make its installation, there are still things that need
to be done by hand, maybe even by a system administrator.

  First, you'll need a hostname.  Get the @PACKAGE@.<your-domain>
DNS name to be created, pointing on the IP address of the host you're
installing @FORGENAME@ on.  The "@PACKAGE@" part isn't required, you
can call it however you like.  However, I'll assume you chose
"@PACKAGE@" from now on; substitute as needed.

  If you want to use the Apache virtual hosting service, you'll even
need a delegation of a subdomain.  Get your system administrator to
delegate you the SOA for the @PACKAGE@.<your-domain> subdomain.
This will allow @FORGENAME@ to create new hostnames for projects when
needed (foo.@PACKAGE@.<your-domain>, for instance), as well as some
hostnames needed by the system (for mailing-lists or SCM, for
instance).

  The LDAP server is hosted on the same host and automatically
managed, therefore you should not have to worry too much about it.
You might be able to access it from another host, but I'm not sure
you'll be able to modify the entries in it.  I would advise not to in
any case, since it would make the data contained in the LDAP directory
inconsistent with the real data stored in the PostgreSQL database.

  You'll need a configured MTA for @FORGENAME@.  Depending on whether
the @FORGENAME@ users are local or remote, you might need to set up a
smarthost or something else.  @FORGENAME@ depends on a working mail
system, and you won't be able to create user accounts without it.  I'm
not sure yet what advanced tricks need to be done with the MTA.  There
might be some stuff to do with virtual domains for mailing-lists or
user email forwarding...  I haven't fully investigated it yet.  Your
contribution will be most welcome.

  Depending on the targeted audience, you might want to get a real
SSL/TLS certificate from some certification authority, whether it be a
professional one or your personal one (or the one in your company).
Otherwise, just use mod-ssl-makecert as advised during the
configuration phase, and get your own custom certificate.

  Do *not* delete the /etc/@PACKAGE@/*.template files.  They are
needed.  Do not alter them either unless you *know* what you're doing.

  See /usr/share/doc/@PACKAGE@-web-apache2/README.Debian(.gz) for
more details about the Apache webserver configuration options for
FusionForge.

Custom local configuration
--------------------------
With default Debian settings, a set of conf files have been generated,
and will contain the desired settings for runtime :
 - @CONFIG_PATH@/config.ini
 - @CONFIG_PATH@/config.ini.d/*.ini

They are standard Windows-style *.ini files, and can be updated with
any text editor.  They should be taken into account immediately by the
web part of the forge and any subsequent runs of the cron jobs.  Note
however that some require manual intervention: for instance, if you
change the name of the database, you will need to perform the
appropriate steps in the database server too.

Instead of changing the contents of the existing file, you may wish to
add only your custom local settings which differ from the packaged
defaults in a dedicated overriding file, for example in the provided
/etc/@PACKAGE@/config.ini.d/zzzz-local.ini.  This will make it
easier to track local customizations.


Adminning notes
---------------
  Once @FORGENAME@ is set up, it pretty much runs by itself.  There
should be relatively few things to do for the administrator.  The
following are random notes trying to document them.

  You'll need to periodically check the Approve Pending Projects page
as well as the Approve News Bytes one, and take appropriate action.
That can be done by the `admin' user (or any user having admin
permissions on the `siteadmin' project) via the web interface.

  If you need to add skills to the database after installation, you
can use the sf-add-skill script.  Give it a skill (or a list of
skills) and it'll insert it into the databse.  This script is located
in /usr/share/@PACKAGE@/bin/.

  For cvs to work you have to add a symlink doing
ln -s /var/lib/@PACKAGE@/chroot/cvsroot /cvsroot.
We can't do this for Debian policy reason that forbid this.
  For svn similar 
ln -s /var/lib/@PACKAGE@/chroot/svnroot /svnroot is to be done

  Don't forget about adding 
SYSLOGD="-p /dev/log -a /var/lib/@PACKAGE@/chroot/dev/log" in /etc/default/syslog
This is a WARNING you might have seen at install, essential if you run 
anonymous cvs in a root jail (This is the default in Debian)

  If you would like to add a theme to your @FORGENAME@, you'll first
have to compose it.  Please refer to README.Themes.

  Other customisations are described in README.Custom.


Thanks
------
  Apart from the SourceForge crew at VA Linux, who did (and probably
still do) a great job with SF, I'd like to send my thanks to Guillaume
Morin, who wrote a very thorough SourceForge installation guide.  That
guide gives step-by-step instructions for the installation procedure,
and a big part of the packaging task was to turn these instructions
into automated scripts.  Even if this package has evolved a lot since
then, it was originally based on his guide.

  Thanks also to all who tested packages and helped correct many
errors of mine.  In particular, thanks to all who submitted patches.

  And mega-thanks to Christian Bayle.  That guy single-handedly
adapted and fixed all the scripts related to SCM, DNS, SSH accounts,
and probably more.
