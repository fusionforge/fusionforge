Default: true
_Description: Do you want mail to ${noreply} to be deleted?
 @FORGENAME@ sends plenty of e-mail from the "${noreply}" address,
 and maybe even some e-mail to that address too.
 .
 It is advised that you let the package direct e-mail to that address to a
 black hole (/dev/null), unless you have another use for that address.
 .
 Accepting this option will perform that redirection.
