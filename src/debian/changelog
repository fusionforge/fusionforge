    the Apache config.  This makes it possible to run FusionForge as

gforge (4.7.2-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fixed require directives in cronjobs (again, this is only for the 4.7

gforge (4.7~rc2-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Removed gforge-plugins-extra binary package (closes: #504758).  I
    can't promise to do security support for it, and it's quite
    susceptible to security holes since it ships local copies of PHP

gforge (4.6.99+svn6319-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New SVN snapshot (r6319).  This includes a bugfix for the creation of
    a relation between a tracker item and a task (closes: #376095), and a
    few German localisation updates (closes: #375526).
  * The SCM plugins now depend on some gforge-shell, since they're useless
    without it anyway.
  * Updated gforge-shell-postgresql dependency to point to openssh-server
    rather than ssh.  Also added a recommendation on nscd.
  * Updated the list of registered themes to match what's actually

  * New SVN snapshot (r6313).  Gettext transition is now complete
    (including the French translation).  Still lots of cleanups.
  * Removed debian/patches/use-fckeditor-from-distro.dpatch, since
    run-time detection was added upstream.
  * Fix maintainer scripts for gforge-plugin-scmcvs and -scmsvn (no
    db-upgrade.pl/db-delete.pl script to call).
  * Use Unix domain sockets for NSS-pgsql too.
  * gforge-shell-postgresql now depends on libnss-pgsql2 rather than the
    old libnss-pgsql1.
  * Switch to using ucf for management of config files, instead of

    provided by the fckeditor package rather than shipping our own copy of it
    (closes: #452597).

  * New SVN snapshot (r6219).  Includes lots of fixes for PHP warnings,
    some internationalisation work, and fixes for IPv6 compatibility.
  * Apache virtual hosts are now available on every IP address, so they'll

  * debian/patches/unix-sockets-for-database.dpatch: Use Unix sockets to
    connect to the PostgreSQL server.

    vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-3921).

  * Make sure there's at least a dummy SSL certificate set up, even if
    it's the Snake Oil cert; the admin is expected to replace it with a
    real cert if possible, but this should ensure the initial SSL setup is
    at least working (closes: #433826).

gforge (4.6.99+svn6070-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * SVN snapshot (based on revision 6070, with packaging patches).  Don't
    use for production!
  * Generate gforge-plugin-scmcvs and g-p-scmsvn from the gforge source
    package, since they're maintained in the same upstream repository.
  * New gforge-plugins-extra package, with other plugins.  Not necessarily
    well-tested (or even working).
  * Using local database to avoid problems with PostgreSQL not listening
    to TCP/IP connections by default (closes: #309276, #396127, #415650,
    #420751).
  * Removing support for Apache 1.3 and PostgreSQL < 8.2, since these
    packages are no longer in Debian.
  * Also removing support for LDAP for now, unless someone comes up ready
    to maintain it in a proper shape (closes: #237229, #241389, #296399,
    #296507, #372260, #378616).
  * Added dummy password for the gforge_mta and gforge_nss PostgreSQL
    users, since it no longer seems possible to use an empty password.
  * Fixed Postfix alias resolution (closes: #424697).
  * Actually display the Debconf question asking for an administrative
    password.  On the other hand, I don't think anybody cares for the
    database password, so that question can be skipped.
  * Made cronjobs silent.

gforge (4.5.14-21) unstable; urgency=high

  * More input sanitisation, fixing more cross-site scripting
    vulnerabilities.  Again, security implications cause the high urgency.
  * Also, make sure that the registration procedure happens over SSL.

    <jtarrio@trasno.net> for Galician (closes: #412917), Miroslav Kure
    <kurem@upcase.inf.upol.cz> for Czech (closes: #409655), and Ricardo

gforge (4.5.14-20) unstable; urgency=high

gforge (4.5.14-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Removed (actually, commented out) Listen directives in the
    Apache configuration (closes: #394933) (again).  For some reason,
    Apache doesn't want to start when told to listen on a particular port
    twice.
  * [Roland] Added deb-specific/fix-frs.pl, to move released files to the
    appropriate place according to the new layout mandated by the FRS.

  * [Roland] install-ldap.sh: Ditto for libnss-ldap.conf.
  * [Roland] gforge-mta-exim4: Invoke update-exim4.conf on installation
    and removal, so Exim is actually configured...
  * [Roland] fix-mailing-lists.pl needs to be run as root, not gforge,
    otherwise it has no access to the mailing-lists data.  Fixed
    gforge-mta-mailman.postinst and fix-mailing-lists.pl accordingly.
  * [Roland] install-db.sh: Made purge more resistant (closes: #395088).
  * [Roland] install-ldap.sh: Made installation more resistant.
  * [Roland] Made Apache setup less invasive (closes: #394933).

gforge (4.5.14-13) unstable; urgency=high

    "rname", which is... let's just say the urgency of this upload is
    probably not exaggerated.

gforge (4.5.14-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Fixed the NSS/PAM mess, hopefully.  We now have NSS views so

    Perrier <bubulle@debian.org> and the French l10n team (closes:

    #376155, #311791, #339878, #354591).
  * [Roland] fix-lists-url.dpatch: Fixed URL patterns for Mailman pages
    (closes: #375529).  By using the appropriate URLs, rather than messing
    with Mailman's configuration.  Adapted the Apache config accordingly.
  * [Roland] Fixed Postfix configuration (closes: #376284).
  * [Roland] Removed versioned dependencies on virtual packages, by
    keeping only the existing packages (closes: #376163).  If new
    alternatives appear (for new MTAs or mailing-list managers or anything
    else), I'll be glad to add them in the control file.
  * [Roland] Applied patch from Julien Cristau
    <julien.cristau@ens-lyon.org>, whereby sql2ldif.pl now uses the SQL
    views rather than duplicating their code.

gforge (3.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] It seems the new organisation of the apache (and related)
    packages managed to break quite a lot of things.  Still trying to
    catch up, this time removing a "Listen" directive that would turn out
    to be a duplicate one, thus preventing Apache from running.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Jan 2004 22:45:03 +0100

gforge (3.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Yet another LDAP fix.  This one would completely prevent

    gforge-db-postgresql.cron.d (closes: #225686).
  * [Roland] Cleaned up the Apache installation process so that it works
    more generically with apache{,-perl,-ssl} flavours.  Also use
    /etc/$flavour/conf.d/ directory (thus removing the hack that changed
    the /etc/$flavour/httpd.conf file).

    Should help fix the administrator's e-mail.

    extract the configuration variables from the configuration file, which
    should help gforge-sourceforge-transition work better.

    script may be called from a very sparse environment (cron), in which

    instead of just leaving them as they are.

    does not hang on install (closes: #221172).

    install-db.sh.

  * [Roland] Fixed multiline inline Perl script for gforge-mta-postfix's
    configuration process (I know, I know) (closes: #219379).
  * [Roland] install-apache.sh now uses the new "modules-config" mechanism
    provided by Apache packages to enable/disable modules, instead of
    uncommenting LoadModules lines by script (closes: #219745).
  * [Roland] Fixed update-user-group-cvs.sh's handling of lockfiles
    (closes: #219957).
  * [Christian] corrected SYSLOGD warning to 'you must have

gforge (3.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Added 20030822.sql.
  * [Roland] Added scripts to generate a /var/lib/gforge/etc/httpd.vhosts
    file from the database and use that, so projects can use virtual hosts
    other than <projectname>.<domainname>.  Added a
    /etc/gforge/templates/httpd.vhosts.template file, too.

    same bug.

  * [Roland] install-apache.sh: do not exit with an error if Apache fails
    to start, so that people without an SSL certificate will still be able
    to install.
  * [Roland] Fixed db-upgrade.pl.  It seems Postgresql feels free to
    change the return type of a function when it's used by a trigger, but
    doesn't allow the user to change that return type afterwards.  Fix:
    drop trigger and function, re-create function and trigger.

  * [Roland] We can even quit using the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.9586.1.1
    (iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise.Debian.package.sourceforge)
    and start using the newly assigned 1.3.6.1.4.1.9586.100.3
    (iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise.Debian.package.gforge)
    instead.  That means a global s/debSf/debGforge/ in attribute types
    and object classes, in all the files that use LDAP.
  * [Roland] Lots of fixes in the Debconf variable handling.  It should be
    more straightforward now, more logical (variables have been moved to
    their proper package), more policy-compliant (gforge.conf is read and
    Debconf is initialised from it as much as possible), and it even
    actually seems to work.
  * [Christian] Added {cronolog_path} in httpd.conf.template, make it fill
    by gforge-config and removed dependancy on a specific cronolog version
  * [Roland] Fixed create-mailing-lists.pl to change the base URL of newly
    created mailing-lists (Gforge bug #331).  Also added a
    fix-mailing-lists.pl script to fix the previous damage.  We even run
    this script if the previously installed version was likely to have the
    bug.
  * [Roland] and [Christian] Added cn: fiend in LDAP entries for
    mailing-lists.
  * [Roland] Stopped trying to create/modify the base DN of the LDAP
    directory if it already exists.

gforge (3rc2-2) unstable; urgency=low

    for Adullact <michel.bondaz@linac.org>.

  * [Christian] Moved <name> theme in gforge-theme-<name> dir where name
    not gforge or osx.
  * [Roland] Fixed cvs_dump_update.pl so that it creates the homedirs for
    the anoncvs_* users when needed.
  * [Roland] Also fixed database user creation code.
  * [Roland] Depend on cronolog (>= 1.6.2-1), since the binary was
    relocated from /usr/sbin to /usr/bin in that version.
  * [Roland] Clean the source tree so as to be able to build a non-native
    Debian package.
  * [Roland] Restored initial debSfMailingList (Mailman 2.0 version) to
    the LDAP schema, and added the new debSfMailingListMM21 with OID
    1.3.6.1.4.1.9586.1.1.1.2.3 for Mailman 2.1.  Fixed sql2ldif.pl
    accordingly.

    are four separate scripts [user|group|cvs|ssh]_dump_update.pl

    work with both versions (provided the PostgreSQL server is installed
    correctly).
  * [Roland] Applied patches #103 and #104 fixing stuff related with
    Apache-SSL / Apache + mod_ssl.  Thanks, Julien Goodwin

sourceforge (2.6-0+17+gforge-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Started the "gforge" branch, to temporarily host all the
    changes made by Tim Perdue (a.k.a. Bigdisk) in his Gforge fork.
    Hopefully, we'll eventually merge them into the trunk and drop that
    branch, but since his changes seem to be rather large, we can't do
    that instantly.

 -- Roland Mas <roland.mas@free.fr>  Wed, 27 Nov 2002 22:42:02 +0100

sourceforge (2.6-0+17+) experimental; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Introducing the plugin subsystem: some infrastructure is now
    in place to add plugins to Sourceforge.  Currently implemented: a
    table containing a list of installed plugins, a table for a list of
    "this group uses that plugin" relations, one for "this user uses that
    plugin" relations, and a usesPlugin() method for the User and Group
    classes (in PHP).
  * [Roland] Also implemented: a PluginManager class, a Plugin class.

sourceforge (2.6-0+14) experimental; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Uuencoded all binary files in the source package, so that
    dpkg-source can build a .diff.gz from the .orig.tar.gz.  debian/rules
    changed accordingly to uudecode the *.uu files at build time, and to
    remove the resulting files at clean time.
  * [Christian] Made trove cat more editable
  * [Roland] Added integrity constraints between the tables related to the
    Trove map.
  * [Roland] Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.7 and DH_COMPAT to 4.
    Changed Build-Depends-Indep accordingly.
  * [Roland] Applied patch from Vicente Ruiz <vjrj@ourproject.org> to fix
    LDAP installation.
  * [Roland] Added an <IfModule apache_ssl.c> test in sf-httpd.conf so
    that SSL is enabled on Apache-SSL (as opposed to Apache / mod_ssl)
    servers.  Thanks, Kees Louwen <keeslouwen@hotmail.com>.
  * [Christian] Added delete capability in trove map edit
  * [Christian] Added setup_onevar_mainfile function in dsf helper to add
    vars in sourceforge.conf not managed by debconf
  * [Christian] More i18n in /my and /account
  * [Christian] Make user menu themeable
  * [Christian] Applied Mathieu Peltier <Mathieu.Peltier@inrialpes.fr>
    patch to send mail to admin when a project is submitted, and modified
    it to send the mail to all members of siteadmin (id=1) group, also
    applied ftp patch partly.
  * [Christian] Added translation tool in admin (Visualisation only at the
    moment)
  * [Roland] Added missing dependency on php4-cgi for package
    sourceforge-web-apache.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Sort documents by title.
  * [Roland] Fix email delivery to users, patch from Vicente Ruiz.
  * [Otavio] Now the browser accepted language are only read if set.
  * [Christian] i18n for project Approval/Rejection/Submission mail.
  * [Paddington] Patch #577 by Andreas Schrattenecker
    <andreas.schrattenecker@aon.at>: preserve release date hh:mm in "Edit
    Releases".
  * [Roland] Added eval magic in install-ldap.sh to help debugging.
    "export DEBSFDEBUG=1" will disable all the redirections, thus showing
    the STDOUT and STDERR of all commands.
  * [Roland] Added extra columns (use_ftp, use_tracker, use_frs,
    use_stats, enable_pserver, enable_anoncvs) in the groups table.
  * [Christian] added web management of these new columns, now you can
    hide almost everything in project page.
  * [Roland] sourceforge-ldap-openldap now depends on libnss-ldap.  This
    should not be necessary and will have to be fixed at some point, but
    for now I'm just too lazy to move the code from install-ldap.sh to
    another, more appropriately named, script.
  * [Roland] Applied patch #614 from Robert Lamoureux
    <Robert.Lamoureux@tfn.com> fixing various problems with themes.
    Thanks, Bob!
  * [Roland] Included full Spanish translation from Vicente Ruiz.  Thanks
    a lot, Vicente!
  * [Roland] Changes to the supported_languages table: the language_code
    field is now 5 characters wide (2 characters previously).  We can thus
    rename the language code for Brazilian to its proper value, pt_BR.
    Also renamed the files to PortugueseBrazilian with one 'l' only, which
    is the proper spelling for it.
  * [Roland] Also, added a foreign key constraint: the doc_data table
    references a language_id.
  * [Christian] Made project admin menu themeable
  * [Christian] Made news menu themeable
  * [Christian] A lot of i18n in forum_utils
  * [Christian] You can now customize date format in language tab files
  * [Roland] Applied patch #617 from Robert Lamoureux.  Stats should now
    work!  Changes are detailed below, with a [Bob] prefix.
  * [Bob] Fixed initial pass problem with calculate_user_metric.php so
    user ratings statistics now run.
  * [Bob] Fixed db_ commit() error in project_weekly_metric.php.  Project
    statistics now work.
  * [Bob] Fixed stats_http_logparse.pl to look for HTTP access log entries
    in the right place (/var/log/sourceforge).
  * [Bob] Changed sf-httpd.conf to have all sourceforge Virtual Web
    servers log all activity to /var/log/sourceforge.  Introduced a
    dependency on cronolog.  The stats Perl files all assume a YYYY/MM/DD
    directory structure for the log files.
  * [Bob] Fixed rules file to install cron jobs into /bin directory.
  * [Bob] Changed sourceforge-db-postgresql cron file to call the stats
    jobs every night.
  * [Bob] Changed the views_graph.png and users_graph.png files to
    generate an empty graph when no data is present rather than a broken
    image icon.  Also, fixed a bug that would break the graph if there was
    0 or only 1 row in the database.
  * [Bob] Changed stats_logparse.sh to have the full path to the scripts.
    We cannot assume we will be in the right directory when it runs.
  * [Bob] Fixed relative paths to utils/include.pl since all cronjobs seem
    to installed in the bin directory.  The old path was 3 levels down in
    the cronjobs directory which is not part of the install hierarchy.
  * [Roland] Applied patch #637 from Mathieu Peltier
    <Mathieu.Peltier@inrialpes.fr>.  Changes are detailed below, with
    entries having a [Mathieu] prefix.
  * [Mathieu] Fixed project title displayed when the forum of a news item
    is viewed (was always 'Site Admin News' instead of the name of the
    project).
  * [Mathieu] Fixed typos in www/forum/forum_utils.php,
    www/include/Base.tab, www/include/menu.php and
    www/include/Layout.class.
  * [Mathieu] Removed 'Edit' and '?' links for root trove category in the
    trove map.
  * [Christian] you can now have a customized pre.php in
    /etc/sourceforge/custom/pre.php
  * [Roland] Changed the authentication system: the authoritative password
    field is now unix_pw, even for authenticating web sessions.  We keep
    user_pw for better performance when looking up the user entry in the
    database, but it is just a cached value that is recomputed from the
    unix_pw when possible (except when said unix_pw is empty, in which
    case user_pw is the reference, and unix_pw is recomputed when
    possible).  This allows for better integration with existing systems
    (for instance, if you want to inject some existing accounts into the
    database...).
  * [Roland] A little i18n in the user's homepage.
  * [Christian] added James Michael DuPont proposed files from
    http://introspector.sourceforge.net/sfexport.tgz . This means 2 files:
    bug_dump.php and patch_dump.php
  * [Christian] Added the supposed userIsAdmin() function in Group class
    used in bug_dump.php and patch_dump.php
  * [Christian] Made some change in bug_dump.php and patch_dump.php to make
    them work (partially), this need actually to manually create two views since in 2.6
    patch and bug tables don't exist, scripts creating views are view_bug.sql and
    view_patch.sql.
  * [Roland] Make HTTPS harder to leave, and make it the default in links
    sent as e-mails (should fix Savannah bug #1401).
  * [Christian] applied paddington patch #644 missing rotate_activity.php,
    generate artifact stats
  * [Christian] more i18n in account management

sourceforge (2.6-0+13) experimental; urgency=low

  * [Christian] Added a dump and restore option to install-db.sh
  * [Christian] Added themeable main page support
  * [Christian] Rewritting of trove_getcatlisting function to
    return a string instead of direct printing
  * [Christian] you can choose default language in local.inc with
    e.g. $sys_lang='French';
  * [Roland] Added the files necessary for sourceforge-mta-postfix.  Yay!
    Our first try at flexibility!  Don't get any funny ideas though, I'm
    pretty confident it doesn't work.  Yet.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Changed the way we empty the LDAP directory, so as
    not to kill entries that are not ours.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Fixed last inserted languages.
  * [Soon-Son] added group write permission (0664) when creating the
    val-tags file in the CVSROOT directory of each project. Old
    configuration (0644) caused an error when the user tries to tag it as
    follows:
    $cvs up -r xterm-branch
    cvs [server aborted]: cannot write /cvsroot/[...]/CVSROOT/val-tags:
    Permission denied
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] New install-ldap.sh.  Should help killing our LDAP
    problems.  Still waiting for more testing, but it seems to mostly
    work.  There's still a bug in it, but it should be fairly simple to
    fix and I'm working on it.
  * [Roland] Various other cleanings in install-ldap.sh.
  * [Roland] Fixed dependencies of the packages.  Not as if it were really
    important before multi-host installations are officially supported,
    but it's good to do it nevertheless.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] common/include/User.class: Fixed Unix UID
    attribution, so that accounts activated by hand by the admin are given
    an UID too.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] deb-specific/db-upgrade.pl: Fixed the backlog of
    wrong UIDs.
  * [Roland] Applied patch #417 from Chris Rudd <chris@omegaware.com>
    (very slightly modified) to spread the use of the util_send_mail()
    function.  Thanks, Chris.
  * [Roland] Also applied patch #418 from same Chris Rudd to help
    portability on Cygwin platforms.  Thanks, Chris.
  * [Roland] utils/new_parse.pl: Applied patch from Manik Surtani
    <manik.surtani@conchango.com> fixing a few paths.
  * [Christian] Update language_code in supported_languages table.  It's
    used to have a default language corresponding to browser language
    settings.
  * [Christian] More i18n on Trove map (work in progress).
  * [Christian] More i18n in group, French translation added too.
  * [Christian] Added choice for default language and theme in debconf.
  * [Roland] Made some scripts silent (including some cron jobs).  They
    should have been silent earlier, but shell redirection is trickier
    than I thought.
  * [Roland] README.Themes: Added a section on theme naming to avoid name
    conflicts.
  * [Christian] added choice for default language and theme in debconf
  * [Christian] more i18n for account register
  * [Christian] cosmetics/i18n in bugtracker
  * [Christian] removed multi record bug in software map
  * [Roland] Dropped and recreated the views related to the artifact
    manager, to fix the artifact bug (couldn't submit new artifacts,
    couldn't add new comments to existing ones, couldn't attach files).
    Thanks to Andreas Schrattenecker <andreas.schrattenecker@aon.at> for
    the bug report and analysis.

sourceforge (2.6-0+12) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Added support for local overloading of the default
    translation files.  See README.Custom for details.
  * [Roland] Applied Olafur's "Making DNS simpler" patch, with a few
    changes.
  * [Roland] Applied Soon-Son's patch #281 increasing internationalisation
    and the Korean translation.
  * [Roland] Split the package into no less than eleven subpackages.  This
    isolates different features into different packages, and it also paves
    the road to multi-host installations (that part is not done yet).
  * [Roland] To facilitate this splitting, a bit of magic was introduced.
    I hereby present DSF-Helper to the face of the world.  This script is
    inspired from dh_installdeb, and basically does a search-and-replace
    on template files.  This allows us to share bits of code (for
    maintainer scripts) or text (Debconf templates) between several
    packages without having to maintain consistency by hand.  The
    code/text is in one file, and is inserted in the appropriate files
    when the package is built.
  * [Roland] Cleaned debian/rules file a bit.
  * [Christian] Added box1_get_alt_row_style function in Layout.class that
    replace html_get_alt_row_color from html.php. This will help to solve
    problems with savannah themes. I also made the necessary changes in
    savannah styles
  * [Soon-Son] fixed bug # 148 (malformed part on dns.zone)
  * [Soon-Son] fixed bug # 431 (Number of public forum/msg are 0)
  * [Soon-Son] removed all links to nonexistent document
  * [Soon-Son] more i18n effort including patch # 283
  * [Soon-Son] removed dtd definition for bug # 120
  * [Christian] Repared trove map count
  * [Roland] Fixed invocation of tarballs.sh in crontab.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Fixed mailing-lists entries in LDAP.
  * [Roland] Included entries from the 2.5 changelog file into this one.
    Don't worry it the dates are not ordered.  Development has been
    concurrent for a while (and still is).  Such merges should happen
    until the 2.5 branch is abandoned.
  * [Roland] Added missing languages.
  * [Christian] added checks in sourceforge-config
  * [Christian] install/desinstall cycle support for common, web-apache,
    db-postgress
  * [Christian] Added ssh-nonfree support
  * [Christian] Added many Replaces: sourceforge in control files

  * [Christian] removed link to docman BUG #122 CLOSED

sourceforge (2.6-0+10) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Christian] Corrected wrong link in menu.php for lastlogin.php.
  * [Roland] *Lots* of patches from Olafur Osvaldsson <oli@isnic.is>
    applied, many thanks to him.
  * [Roland] Changed about.php page so that it now speaks about Debian
    Sourceforge.  It's internationalised, too.
  * [Roland] Page footer is now shorter, internationalised, and pointing
    to the About page.
  * [Roland] Fixed links in the Site News page.
  * [Roland] Made groups siteadmin and newsadmin public to prevent
    problems with submitting of news.  Also, changed their names for
    coherence with names inherited from the 2.5 branch.
  * [Christian] Continuing work on theming, added a new function in
    html.php (url_html)
  * [Roland] Removed a few bashisms in maintainer scripts.
  * [Christian] Added savannah converted themes and appropriate db inserts
  * [Christian] Added README.Themes

sourceforge (2.6-0+9) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Christian] Added dependancy on rcs for our patched cvsweb
  * [Roland] Renamed db-upgrade26.pl to db-upgrade.pl.
  * [Roland] Split the parse_sql_file function out of db-upgrade.pl and
    into its own file (sqlparser.pm).
  * [Roland] Fixed configuration of apache-ssl.
  * [Roland] Worked to make the database scheme independent of the upgrade
    path: installing 2.6 over 2.5 now yields the same scheme as installing
    2.6 from scratch.  Well, actually, not quite, but the differences are
    only in a few constraints, and that'll be taken care of when we
    provide some way to backup and restore a database.
  * [Roland] db-upgrade.pl: replay the database "fixes" included in the
    2.5 packages before starting the conversion to 2.6, to permit upgrades
    from versions that are not the latest in the 2.5 series.
  * [Christian] gig2png conversion to make GNU happy.
  * [Christian] some html cleaning in Layout.class and osdn.php
  * [Christian] added Add, Delete, or Edit Themes in Site Utilities for admin
  * [Christian] change uid/gid attribution in ldap.php to be backend compliant
  * [Christian] added debian and savannah Themes
  * [Roland] Remove /cvsroot symlink on purge.
  * [Roland] Insert the appropriate rows in the database for themes.
  * [Roland] Added a "checkpoint" in db-upgrade.pl, so that we should now
    be able to provide upgrades between different releases in the 2.6
    series.
  * [Roland] Added a totally rewritten Korean language translation file
    provided by Soon-Son Kwon <kss@kldp.org>.  Many thanks to him.
  * [Roland] Also rewrote the French language translation file, so as to
    not be lagging behind the Koreans :-)
  * [Roland] Also fixed a few typoes in the English language.
  * [Christian] Removed confusing unused image from archive and put in unused
    directory in cvs, preparing easy Theming
  * [Christian] Theming should be easier though not complete

sourceforge (2.6-0+8) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Christian] Added debian/BUGS
  * [Christian] Corrected approve_pending bug
  * [Christian] Corrected wrong userid for CVS
  * [Christian] Fixed libmcryp4 dependancy
  * [Christian] Added anoncvs_ users in ldap db
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Added man page for sourceforge-config (from a
    Docbook SGML file).  This fixes a lintian error.
  * [Christian] Added ldap support for chrooted anonymous cvs
  * [Roland] Minor typo-fixes here and there, and a few cosmetic changes.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Fixed unix_box entries.
  * [Roland] Fixed leftover cruft in /etc/nsswitch.conf purging.
  * [Roland] Made the header somewhat customizable (display/hide the
    banner, mainly).
  * [Roland] Transitioned to PostgreSQL 7.2.  That was far from easy,
    since PG 7.2 is much more anal retentive than 7.1.3.  In particular,
    foreign key constraints and indices are not automagically dropped,
    which caused strange errors and deep frustration in the upgrade path
    from the 2.5 series.
  * [Roland] While I was fixing that, I also took the opportunity to add
    some code to drop the useless "deadXX" columns that are introduced by
    the 2.5->2.6 upgrade (ALTER TABLE/DROP COLUMN not being implemented in
    PostgreSQL yet).
  * [Roland] Moved a few SQL statements used only in the 2.5->2.6 upgrade
    from db-upgrade26.pl to sf2.5-to-sf2.6.sql.

sourceforge (2.6-0+7) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Added templates to conffiles.
  * [Roland] Added debconf magic to ask whether to replace a config file
    before doing it (in the post-installation and pre-remove phases).
  * [Christian] Changed to use cvsweb
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Added "-s /bin/sh" when su'ing to postgres.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Moved templates to a Policy-compliant location
    (/etc/sourceforge/templates).
  * [Christian] modify install-ldap.sh to follow slapd undocumented
    changes
  * [Christian] removed test on /etc/ldap.secret in sourceforge.config
  * [Christian] changed template in local.inc.template to remove People in
    sys_ldap_admin dn

sourceforge (2.6-0+6) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Added docs.
  * [Roland] Added libmime-base64-perl and libhtml-parser-perl to
    dependencies (db-upgrade26.pl now uses MIME::Base64 and
    HTML::Entities).
  * [Roland] Added migration capability to the db-upgrade26.pl script.
    Database upgrades smoothly from 2.5 to 2.6.  Hopefully.  Not very well
    tested yet.
  * [Christian] Removed libmcrypt bug workaround

  * [Roland] Updated Standards-Version to 3.5.6.0.
  * [Roland] Made the package arch-independent.
  * [Roland] Updated debian/TODO a bit.
  * [Roland] Fixed a few minor bugs in my/index.php.
  * [Roland] Fixed speling error in Description: field.
  * [Roland] Added dependencies on packages providing the vi editor.
  * [Roland] www/include/Layout.class (and others): Removed the VA logo in
    the site icon.  The new site icon now consists of a black "SF" written
    over a Debian swirl.
  * [Roland] deb-specific/install-ldap.sh: Test for the existence of
    /etc/ldap/slapd.conf before trying to modify it, and suggest to
    reconfigure slapd if it is not present.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Ported the new LDAP schema, that had been
    forgotten for some reason.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Fixed email addresses on the users' home page.
  * [Roland] Added the login name and real name of the user whose
    permissions in a project are being edited.
  * [Roland] Replaced a call to /etc/init.d/bind9 restart by a (more
    appropriate) reload.  Used the policy-defined invoke-rc.d, too.
  * [Roland] Fixed dependencies to correctly handle apache-ssl and
    exim-tls.

sourceforge (2.6-0+3) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Christian] Added proper chmod for cp -r www and common
  * [Christian] Added homedir_prefix and groupdir_prefix in
    local.inc.template and made the change in account.php to take this in
    account
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Rewrote the config file handling, so that it does
    not overwrite local changes.
  * [Roland] [From 2.5] Added cvssh.pl.

  * [Christian] Repared bad db init 

 -- Christian Bayle <bayle@aist.enst.fr>  Sat, 17 Nov 2001 01:29:25 +0100

sourceforge (2.6-0+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Started working on 2.6.  Don't expect it to work just yet.
  * Split the DB installation/deinstallation process out of
    postinst/postrm/prerm and into an install-db.sh script.  Made it a bit
    less verbose.
  * Split the Apache installation/deinstallation process out of
    postinst/prerm and into an install-db.sh script.
  * Cleaned the exim configuration a bit.
  * Cleaned the DNS configuration a bit.
  * Cleaned the install-*.sh scripts a lot.  They now all look the same,
    are more readable (well, they are more readable to me), and work
    approximately the same way.  Added a template for future such scripts
    (install-skel.sh).
  * [Christian] Put utils/include.pl utils/sql2ldif.pl
    utils/underworld-dummy/ssh_dump.pl of 2.5 as 2.6 scripts, sql2ldif
    will probably have to be re-seen
  * [Christian] Added sf-2.6-complete.sql script
  * [Christian] Cleaned debian/rules
  * [Christian] Added path in apache template
  * deb-specific/db-upgrade26.pl: Rewrote the SQL parsing state machine so
    that it 1. works better, 2. is more readable, 3. knows about comments,
    4. knows about COPY [...] FROM stdin.
  * [From 2.5 branch] Fixed install-cvs.sh so that it no longer inserts
    too many lines in the inetd.conf file.
  * [From 2.5 branch] Added sf_ldap_modify_if_exists() to
    www/include/ldap.php.  Works the same as sf_ldap_modify, but returns a
    non-error if the LDAP entry does not exist.  Patched
    sf_ldap_user_set_attribute to use this new function, so that even
    users with no account (or no account yet) can change their passwords
    and personal info.
  * Adapted the patch to display the site admin menu, from using the now
    deprecated function user_ismember() to using the new (2.6) methods
    involving Group and Permission objects.
  * [From 2.5 branch] Improved personal page: site admin(s) now see(s) a
    list of pending projects, and news admin(s) see(s) a list of pending
    news bytes.
  * Replaced calls to /etc/init.d/<script> <action> in maintainer scripts
    with invoke-rc.d <script> <action>, as per policy.
  * Slightly rewrote the template handling in postinst script, to allow
    parsing for files not in /etc/sourceforge (not needed yet, but it
    might come in handy).
  * Removed an unneeded dependency on bash (in install-chroot.sh).
  * Added resolution data.  Fixes the "Can't submit a bug/patch/whatever"
    bug.

sourceforge (2.5-34) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Christian] made that adduser don't break postinst
  * [Otavio] Added the possibility to change default language using a
    system variable called $sys_lang (look in /etc/sourceforge/local.inc).
  * [Otavio] Added the commentary in /etc/sourceforge/local.inc about
    $sys_theme.
  * [Christian] Applied Otavio patch and updated postinst consequantly
  * [Roland] Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.7 and DH_COMPAT to 4.
  * [Otavio] Patch to fix user deletion (closes: #162793).
  * [Roland] Sort documentations by title.
  * [Roland] Updated language codes in the database.
  * [Roland] Otavio's patch #552: better handling of the browser language
    preferences.

    occur when upgrading (closes: #159277).

sourceforge (2.5-32) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] www/admin/useredit.php: Fixed Unix UID attribution, so that
    accounts activated by the admin are given an UID too.  Previously only
    the accounts that were entering a group got given an UID, and that
    could result in people existing in the LDAP database and having a
    shell account yet no UID.  Thanks to Otavio Salvador
    <otavio@debian.org> for the report and help in fixing.
  * [Roland] deb-specific/db-upgrade.pl: Fixed the backlog of wrong UIDs.
  * [Roland] utils/new_parse.pl: Applied patch from Manik Surtani
    <manik.surtani@conchango.com> fixing a few paths.
  * [Soon-Son] fixed an error when rating a user. The error message was
    as follows: (Fatal error: Call to a member function on a non-object 
    in /usr/lib/sourceforge/www/include/User.class on line 666)
  * [Roland] Hot news!  ProFTPd is now in main!  Sourceforge migrated back
    from non-US to main.  Ftpmasters: sorry about all the fuss.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Sep 2002 18:35:18 +0200

sourceforge (2.5-31) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Soon-Son] added method="post" to massmail.php which was missing so
    far so that the admin can send email to the users
  * [Roland] Revamped install-ftp.sh more or less thoroughly in order to
    finally get rid of the sneaky LDAP problems.  From what I can see, it
    works.  Yay!
  * [Roland] Various other cleanings in install-ldap.sh.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Aug 2002 13:01:49 +0200

sourceforge (2.5-30) unstable; urgency=high

  * [Christian] Change gid/uid attribution in ldap.php to be like in
    backend
  * [Christian] Added asciize function in ldap.php because
    LDAP expects utf-8 encoded character string (backport from 2.6)
  * [Roland] Fixed install-ftp.sh so that it actually does install stuff.
  * [Roland] Fixed a few bashisms in maintainer scripts.
  * [Roland] Fixed LDAP entries for mailing-lists (attribute cn: is not in
    the schema).
  * [Roland] Fixed user in crontab (for the DNS stuff) (closes: #147434).
  * [Roland] Fixed bug in the "Submit a bug" form: all bug admins are able
    to assign a bug from the start, not just project admins.
  * [Roland] May I introduce you to Soon-Son Kwon <kss@kldp.org> who
    recently got write access to our CVS repository.  He seems to focus on
    internationalisation and Korean translation, but he is also a source
    of bugfixes and other interesting patches.
  * [Soon-Son] applied patch for bug # 148(savannah project page).
  * [Soon-Son] added "scp" to allowed commands in cvssh.pl
  * [Soon-Son] changed hardcoded "SourceForge" to $GLOBALS[sys_name]
    so that the user can define custom site name.
  * [Soon-Son] modified .../www/forum/message.php so that it can display
    article subject correctly on the title.
  * [Soon-Son] i18n patch for *many* pages (not all yet)
  * [Soon-Son] removed "sourceforge.net" & "VA linux" specific pages
    like .../contest/*, .../mirrors/* and simplified/generalized footer
  * [Roland] Fixed search results page for Software/Group: the link was
    wrong in the case of foundries.
  * [Roland] Fixed POSIXness of maintainer scripts (closes: #150410).
  * [Roland] Added missing languages (closes: #150301).
  * [Christian] Added support for ssh-nonfree
  * [Christian] Hope I solved a postrm bug that made uninstall fail
  * [Soon-Son] fixed "forbidden" error when trying to connect
    download.foobar.net
  * [Roland] Fixed "value too long for type character varying(32)" in the
    db-upgrade.pl script (when inserting local data) for a fresh install
    (closes: #153031).  It was caused by a change of behaviour in the
    md5sum binary provided by dpkg 1.10 and higher.
  * [Roland] Be a little less stupid when emptying the LDAP directory on
    purge (closes: #153032).  Instead of removing all entries but a few,
    we now remove all *our* entries but a few.  Sorry about that.
  * [Roland] When exiting on an error, db-upgrade.pl now tells you the
    request that failed.  That should help debugging.
  * [Roland] Moved the PostgreSQL de-configuration down in the prerm
    script, since the LDAP de-configuration now uses sql2ldif and
    therefore needs access to the database.
  * [Roland] Moved back to non-US.  It seems there was a mistake, and not
    all the dependencies were in main after all.  For some reason, the
    fact that ProFTPd was still in non-US eluded both me and the
    ftpmasters at the time the 2.5-29 package made it into main.  I'm
    sorry about that.
  * [Soon-Son] added group write permission(0664) when creating the val-tags
    file in the CVSROOT directory of each project. Old configuration (0644)
    caused an error when the user tries to tag it as follows:
    $cvs up -r xterm-branch 
    cvs [server aborted]: cannot write /cvsroot/hanterm-xf/CVSROOT/val-tags:
    Permission denied

sourceforge (2.5-29.1) stable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Maintenance release for Debian 3.0r1, the first update of
    Woody.  Only fixing really major bugs, so that the stable release
    manager may accept this package.
  * [Roland] Moved back to non-us, since proftpd is not in main in Woody.
  * [Roland] Backported fix from 2.5-30 so that uninstalling will not
    completely remove the LDAP directory, but only the entries generated
    from our database.  This fixes bug #153032 in Woody.

sourceforge (2.5-29) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Moved to main.  I promise the only changes in this package
    are this changelog entry and the Section: field of debian/control.
  * Note to ftpmasters, #1: there's no crypto code in this package, only
    dependencies.  I'm not sure you need to notify the BXA or anything.
  * Note to ftpmasters, #2: this package depends on libdbd-pg-perl, which
    is currently in queue/new.  Take care not to process sourceforge
    before libdbd-pg-perl.
  * Note to ftpmasters, #3: this package also has a dependency on
    libapache-mod-ssl | apache-ssl.  At the time of writing, only
    apache-ssl has transitioned to main, but the package is still
    installable without any non-US-only component.  My interpretation is
    that this is enough to allow the transition.  If not, well, I'll bug
    the libapache-mod-ssl maintainer so that he goes through this
    transition.
  * Note to ftpmasters, #4: I chose the "devel" subsection because I felt
    it was most appropriate.  "web" would be inaccurate (mailing-lists and
    CVS are not web stuff).  In a quick survey on IRC, no really
    convincing arguments were put up for (or against) either.
  * Note to ftpmasters, #5: "Thank you for your contribution to Debian"
    yourself.  You do a great job.  Thanks a lot guys.

  * [Roland] Fixed the shell box hostname entries (again) in db-upgrade.pl
    (closes: #137183).
  * [Christian] Added dependency on rcs for cvsweb (closes: #137811).
    Yes, we need to have our own cvsweb, since it's a patched version.
  * [Roland] Bumped the sequences for bug and task ids so that they are
    greater than 100.  If they are not, the 100th task/bug will have a
    wrong list or reverse dependencies (since 100 is the id of "None", and
    all tasks and bugs depend on this "None" by default.  This patch
    should prevent that from happening if it hasn't already.  It won't fix
    existing sites where the 100th bug/task already exists, though.  If
    you are in such a situation, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for
    you.  Your best bet would be to declare that bug/task closed and
    recreate another, identical, one.

  * [Christian] Made big changes in install-ldap.sh to be ok with
    slapd config.
  * [Roland] Removed unused dir /usr/lib/sourceforge/templates.
  * [Roland] Recalculated $version in db-upgrade.pl.
  * [Roland] Mentioned the .sourceforge-old backup files in the debconf
    question.
  * [Roland] Versioned Depends: on slapd (the admin dn seems to have
    changed).
  * [Roland] Fixed cleaning of LDAP-related files on purge.
  * [Roland] Also fixed cleaning of LDAP directory on remove.
  * [Roland] Updated debian/TODO a bit.  It seems we mostly have "can wait
    until / will be done in / already done in the 2.6 series" entries now,
    which is cool.
  * [Roland] Removed an invalid (and useless) request from
    approve-pending.php.  Should remove a few lines in PostgreSQL error
    logs.
  * [Roland] A few changes here and there to get Sourceforge working with
    the recently uploaded PostgreSQL 7.2, see items tagged [PG7.2] below.
  * [Roland] [PG7.2] Send HUP signal to postmaster in postinst and prerm
    scripts.  This because PostgreSQL now only re-reads the pg_hba.conf
    file upon receiving this signal (and no more on each connection).
  * [Roland] [PG7.2] Fixed insertion of over-long hostnames in the
    database (db-upgrade.pl).
  * [Roland] Also in db-upgrade.pl: fixed the (probably truncated)
    existing unix_box entries.
  * [Roland] Various minor fixes here and there: Debconf templates,
    install-dap.sh, sourceforge-config.sgml, qrs.php.
  * [Christian] change gid determination in install-ftp.sh update 
  * [Roland] Overall urgency set to medium, since 2.5-25 is broken with
    recent slapds and PostgreSQLs.

  * [Roland] Rewrote the setup_vars() function in install-ldap.sh for more
    robustness.
  * [Roland] Added manpage for sourceforge-config (fixes lintian error).
  * [Christian] Added ':' in /etc/nsswitch.conf
  * [Christian] Added do_config template
  * [Roland] Wrote the code behind the do_config debconf variable.
  * [Roland] Also, do not completely replace the existing configuration in
    /etc/nsswitch.conf.  Only add 'ldap' in there.  This, and the two
    previous entries, makes the package well-behaved (closes: #134058).
  * [Roland] Moved template files to /etc/sourceforge/templates
    (Policy for conffiles) (closes: #134724).
  * [Roland] Specified shell when su'ing to postgres.  Will hopefully help
    in resolving #130230, but I'm not sure yet so I don't close it.
  * [Roland] Added Korean language class provided by Soon-Son Kwon

  * [Roland] Fixed speling error in Description: field (closes: #125372).
  * [Roland] Added dependencies on packages providing the vi editor
    (closes: #124326).  I hope I got them all.
  * [Roland] deb-specific/install-exim.sh: Fixed LDAP queries to match the
    real attribute names from the new schema introduced in 2.5-15.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Dec 2001 10:12:30 +0100

sourceforge (2.5-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Fixed a lintian error.
  * [Roland] Fixed a bug in postinst: just having a LoadModule line in
    httpd.conf doesn't mean the module is present (closes: #122413).

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Dec 2001 11:54:57 +0100

  * [Christian] Added proper chmod for cp -r of www

sourceforge (2.5-15) unstable; urgency=medium

  * [Christian] LDAP cleanup: Added access to userPassword for SF_robot
    (Thanks to Justin Richer), made a clean LDAP purge, made
    install-ldap.sh more silent and backport from 2.6.
  * deb-specific/sourceforge.schema, utils/sql2ldif.pl: Changed schema to
    use assigned OIDs, a saner naming scheme and better attribute types.
  * install-ldap.sh: Replaced calls to "/etc/init.d/slapd restart" with
    "invoke-rc.d slapd restart" (policy).
  * install-ldap.sh: Clean the LDAP directory on package removal (closes:
    #118516).
  * Rewrote grap.c (cvssh) in Perl, to allow for a greater portability.
    Switched the architecture to arch: all accordingly.
  * Merged in patch from Justin Richer: fix the changing of a user's
    password by the admin.
  * Also from Justin's patch (slightly rewritten): admin now sees a list
    of pending projects on his homepage.
  * This was not in Justin's patch, but he inspired the idea: news admin
    sees a list of pending news bytes on his personal page too.
  * Still from Justin's patch (a bit rewritten): fixed "My Projects" links
    on personal pages so that they point to the right place in case the
    project is a foundry.
  * Added sf_ldap_modify_if_exists() to www/include/ldap.php.  Works the
    same as sf_ldap_modify, but returns a non-error if the LDAP entry does
    not exist.  Patched sf_ldap_user_set_attribute to use this new
    function, so that even users with no account (or no account yet) can
    change their passwords and personal info.
  * Fixed install-cvs.sh so that it no longer inserts too many lines in
    the inetd.conf file.
  * Rewrote the config file handling, so that it does not overwrite local
    changes (closes: #120442).

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Nov 2001 14:46:29 +0100

sourceforge (2.5-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made install-dns.sh a bit more silent.
  * Same for the db-upgrade.pl, which is now piped to an appropriate grep.
  * Added a Depends: on perl-suid (for fileforge.pl).
  * Made sure the incoming and download dirs are created and have correct
    permissions.  Cleaned new_parse.pl a bit, accordingly.
  * Changed Priority: from optional to extra to avoid overrides.
  * Various fixes and cleanups.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Nov 2001 19:01:59 +0100

sourceforge (2.5-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed config so that the database password is set to what the user
    types (and not randomly generated).

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Nov 2001 18:52:29 +0100

sourceforge (2.5-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a PATH problem in install-ldap.sh.
  * Made the cronjobs silent.

sourceforge (2.5-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed /etc/aliases entry for sourceforge user.  Really, this time.
  * Fixed Trove software map (closes: #108297).
  * Added sf-add-skill and sf-register-theme scripts.
  * Removed the need for chsh sourceforge in update-user-group-cvs.sh.
  * Fixed user list and group list.
  * [Christian] Added support for sites without DNS delegation.
  * Included patch from Olivier Garcia <olivier@linux-nerd.com>: support
    for multiple network cards.
  * Made sourceforge.config ash-compatible.
  * Fixed User.class (closes: #108682).
  * Added the alias for the Mailman images in sf-httpd.conf.template.
  * Fixed the most important entry in the zone file (ours).
  * Email forwarding should now work (through LDAP).  I'm afraid this has
    required that we depend on exim specifically (instead of any other
    MTA).  If you desperately need support for another MTA, please read
    (and understand) deb-specific/install-exim.sh and send me the
    appropriate install-<your-MTA-here>.sh for inclusion.
  * Fixed fill-in-the-blanks.pl to allow multiple replacements of the same
    token on the same line.  That was needed by some magic that's not here
    anymore, but it's better nevertheless.
  * [Christian] Added SF_robot and Replicator entry in sql2ldif script.
  * [Christian] Made ldap_add_password template var work.
  * Mailing-lists should now work.  The emails should also be sent to the
    list with the same LDAP trick we used for the email forwarding, and
    the web part of Mailman be correctly configured.
  * Fixed apache-ssl support (apache + libapache-mod-ssl was the only
    combination I had previously tested).
  * [Christian] Added ldap check in apache/php config.
  * [Christian] Ldap online support enabled.  Requires intensive testing
    and probably security enhancements similar to database.
  * Fixed possible infinite loop in cronjobs/calculate_user_metric.php.
  * [Christian] backport of 2_6_1 docman for better language support
  * [Christian] Fixed install-ldap loss of robot password
  * [Christian] Started FTP setup
  * [Christian] Download server added
  * [Christian] File Release FRS support added (closes: #108173)
  * [Christian] Added CVS nightly tarballs
  * Fixed errors in LDAP configuration so that the online creation of
    groups and users works.
  * Fixed a thinko in debian/sourceforge/cron.d.
  * Added a periodical check for the presence of an incoming directory in
    the users' home dir.
  * Fixed versioned dependency on debconf (thanks to lintian).
  * Removed unnecessary CVS/ dirs from the package when it's built from a
    CVS checkout (as opposed to a CVS export).
  * Fix in include.pl to allow the use of an empty password.  To be
    tested, but it might help closing #116009.
  * Delayed deletion of files until the very end of the uninstall process,
    in order to potentially help fixing one symptom described in #116009
    too.
  * deb-specific/install-exim.sh: (still related to, and not closing,
    #116009) no need to require /etc/sourceforge/local.pl when
    deconfiguring.
  * Updated debian/TODO a bit.
  * Added fileforge.pl, a setuid Perl script to move files around securely
    (without needing to grant www-data read/write permission on
    $user/incoming/ directories).
  * [Christian] Splited install-dns.sh in install-dns.sh and
    install-cvs.sh and related modification in prerm and postinst, purge
    is now done for cvs, but i don't use update-inetd that doesn't restore
    old config.  probably cvs maintainer should be contacted to have a
    friendly sourceforge config, because cvs config break sourceforge cvs
    config
  * Migrated install-cvs.sh to update-inetd (using appropriate
    --comment-chars tricks).
  * Fixed top of page background (looked nice on Forged Metal theme, but
    not with any other theme).
  * Deduped releases in the Quick Release System.
  * Fixed searches: broken SQL syntax in the admin-only search, and
    removed case-sensitiveness in the other search.
  * www/include/theme.php: Fixed SQL (removed quotes from integer fields).
  * www/include/theme.php: Changed the default user theme to a saner one.
  * www/include/cache.php: Removed warning when the page is not cached.
  * debian/sourceforge.prerm: Fixed uninstall-time bugs (deluser could
    fail, and the FTP root directory could be non-empty).
  * debian/sourceforge.config: Eventually fixed the empty db_passwd bug
    (closes: #116009).
  * Removed the web-only installation.  All the services work, and there
    is no need for a stripped-down version (which would be full of broken
    links and non-working features).
  * debian/control: Replaced Recommends: with Depends: now that the
    web-only installation is no more.  Removed cvsweb, too, since we
    provide our own version.
  * deb-specific/database.inc.template, deb-specific/local.inc.template,
    deb-specific/sf-httpd.secrets.template: Took the LDAP password out of
    the reach of unallowed users (same trick we used for the database
    password).
  * deb-specific/install-ldap.sh: Rewrote the way the LDAP password was
    handled.
  * Added a debconf note concerning the way libpam-ldap has to be
    configured.
  * [Christian] deb-specific/install-ldap.sh: Fixed incorrect upgrade.
  * Plus a ton of other fixes and cleanups, but this changelog entry is
    already long enough.
  * Today, the 1st of November 2001, I'd like to dedicate this release to
    Édith and Virginie.  So there.

sourceforge (2.5-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * I am starting to get rather confident in this package, to the point
    where I cannot think of major bugs preventing it to enter woody
    (closes: #99336).  It will still have to wait for its dependencies to
    be fulfilled and for its other RC bugs to be fixed/closed, but I won't
    artificially keep it out from testing.
  * Fixed possible double insertion of the sourceforge alias in
    /etc/aliases.
  * Check the presence of, and when needed, add, "extension={pgsql,gd}"
    lines in /etc/php4/{apache,cgi}/php.ini files (closes: #107290).
  * Moved some code where it belongs (in the "if web_only = false"
    if-block) in sourceforge.config.
  * Added a Debconf note to remind the admin to create the SSL/TLS
    certificate.
  * A few cosmetic changes.
  * Added an "Installation notes" paragraph in README.Debian.
  * Removed an entry in the TODO file (now it's a bug on the BTS).
  * Fixed the diary stuff (viewing entries, monitoring other people's
    diary) (closes: #108166, #108169).

  * Changed the way we use the templates (fill-in-the-blanks.pl) and keep
    the postinst script -e (closes: #103902).
  * Continued work on db-upgrade.pl: added a function to parse SQL files.
    The first installation (database initialisation) is now done via this
    script too.
  * Redirected email to sourceforge@domain to the server admin address (as
    specified by the debconf question).
  * Continued the hunt for references to sourceforge.net, including
    removed links to some pages that were too deeply connected with
    sf.net.

sourceforge (2.5-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed references to foundries from the site homepage.

    Savannah.
  * Added French translation into the debconf template.
  * Ask confirmation for passwords in debconf.
  * Other minor tweaks in debconf.
  * Fixed cvsweb "Unable to find gzip binary in $PATH" bug.

  * Fixed the sending of emails in the support request tracker.

  * [Christian] Remove warning from grap.c compilation (Dirty code) 
  * [Christian] Started to reintroduce in local.inc.template things about
    ldap 
  * [Christian] Modified dirs for ftp (things changing have to be in var
    not in usr, remember that a system should work with /usr /etc read
    only, that's why zone files for bind are in var) 
  * Trimmed package dependencies a bit.
  * Improved the way postinst detects an error upon database and user
    creation.
  * Added sfdocs.sql, not (yet) used.
  * [Christian] Fixed incorrect list of shell in account.php (function

  * First upload to Debian (closes: #78847).

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Mon, 14 May 2001 20:18:03 +0200

sourceforge (2.5-0+17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a postinst bug.
  * Merged stuff from Christian again:
    + Moved db_get sourceforge/noreply_to_bitbucket because later db_get
      locks 
    + Created install-ssh.sh and relativ modifs in prerm and postinst
    + Modified local.pl.template to have database access
    + Adding ldap config that allow user/passwd management without
      touching /etc files. LDAP is not directly used from php like it's done
      on current CVS snapshot.
    + By default now ssh don't chroot (Possible, thanks to ldap) and there
      is a symlink /cvsroot to let CVS with ssh run like before and there is
      an option chroot to install-ssh.sh to have chroot again. To have a on
      demand per user chroot, we maybe should create a special shell that to
      this. Because we run in one box cvs imply ssh, this make that a cvs
      writer has got a shell on your box. Chroot restrict access, it would
      also be possible to restrict access using cvssh (alias grap.c) without
      chroot
    + Modified update-user-group-cvs.sh to update ldap tables
    + Correct a mistake in /cvs/ page (Added :ext: at cvs command) 
    + Added cvssh in /bin/
    + Changed sql2lif.pl to have cvssh as default shell in ldap tables
  * Stripped cvssh to make lintian happy.

    + Added sf-httpd.conf.template enhancement for virtual hosting
    + Added vhost_alias_module check in sourceforge.postinst
    + Work on sql2ldif.pl and install-ldap.sh 
  * Fixed crontab so that it doesn't complain when the package is
    uninstalled.
  * Also in crontab: do not start the non-web-only scripts if the
    installation was web-only.
  * Depend on mail-transport-agent.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Fri, 11 May 2001 20:23:13 +0200

  * Restart ssh in prerm.
  * Removed duplicate invocation of debconf for the LDAP stuff in config.
  * Added Depends: on ssh, libnss-ldap and bind9.
  * Heading to a stable state, all unstable stuff is conditioned to a
    debconf question.
  * Removed bashisms in config.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Thu, 10 May 2001 11:10:34 +0200

sourceforge (2.5-0+13.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified sourceforge.config to get a correct ldap DN
  * Changed ldaptest for install-ldap.sh in deb-specific
  * Added sql2ldif.sh and install-ldap.sh in debian/rules
  * Added stuffs for default ldap_dn in sourceforge.config but this should
    be better done
  * Added sourceforge.schema for ldap in etc/sourceforge (Added in rules)
  * Now nstall-ldap.sh is a working loader of the ldap database
  * Probably libnss-ldap will require modif of /etc/nsswitch.conf
  * Added apache_conf.pl example found on sourceforge offsite talk
  * This should help for apache aliasing of sites except if there is a
    solution without restarting apache

  * Everything from my 2.5-0+12p9 is reintegrated

sourceforge (2.5-0+13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Should fix the error on news forum creation (thanks to Y. J. Chun
    <monac@pmail.net>).
  * Added a $sys_images_url (Y. J. Chun again).
  * Started work on the LDAP stuff.  The script seems to work, now I don't
    know what to do with it yet.
  * Run the postinst psql scripts as sourceforge to satisfy PostgreSQL's
    paranoia.
  * Sort-of-fixed a problem occurring when trying to see the source for
    generated pages (/projects/test/, for instance).
  * Fixed the sending of emails to strange addresses on task creation.

 -- Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Apr 2001 19:59:04 +0200

sourceforge (2.5-0+7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the database host to localhost in psql calls from the
    maintainer scripts.  It still doesn't work with out-of-the-box
    PostgreSQL installation (which is a little paranoid), but it should
    lower the requirements for manual intervention.
  * Un-commented the Apache restart in maintainer scripts.  It's really
    needed, especially for the prerm.
  * Cease to drop the databases on remove (only do this un purge).
