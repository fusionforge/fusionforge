FusionForge's installation is fully automated.  However, it requires a
working connection with the database.  If installation failed
(e.g. you configured a remote database which got down during install),
you can re-run it manually for a given FusionForge main package using:

  /usr/share/fusionforge/post-install.d/<pkg_name>/<pkg_name>.sh configure

and for plugins using:

  /usr/share/fusionforge/post-install.d/common/plugin.sh <plugin_name> configure

E.g.:

  /usr/share/fusionforge/post-install.d/common/common.sh configure
  /usr/share/fusionforge/post-install.d/db/db.sh configure
  /usr/share/fusionforge/post-install.d/web/web.sh configure
  /usr/share/fusionforge/post-install.d/shell/shell.sh configure
  /usr/share/fusionforge/post-install.d/common/plugin.sh scmgit configure
