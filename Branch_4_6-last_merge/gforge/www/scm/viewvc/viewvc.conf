# root_as_url_component: Interpret the first path component in the URL
# after the script location as the root to use.  This is an
# alternative to using the "root=" query key. If ViewVC is configured
# with multiple repositories, this results in more natural looking
# ViewVC URLs and allows you to browse checked out HTML files with 
# relative links to other repository files within ViewVC.
# Note: Enabling this option will break backwards compatibility with
# any old ViewVC URL which doesn't have an explicit "root" parameter.

# to work, but old log page urls which don't have explicit "view=log"

# disable this option in a fresh viewvc installation, or if you don't need
# to support old-style log URLs.

# WARNING:
#
#   Enabling this option can consume HUGE amounts of server time. A

#   the result needs to be searched for a match against the regular
#   expression.
#
#
# SECURITY WARNING:  Denial Of Service
#
#   Since a user can enter the regular expression, it is possible for
#   them to enter an expression with many alternatives and a lot of
#   backtracking. Executing that search over thousands of lines over
#   dozens of files can easily tie up a server for a long period of
#   time.
#
# This option should only be used on sites with trusted users. It is
# highly inadvisable to use this on a public site.

# use a different template for a particular view, simply uncomment the
# appropriate option below and specify the currect location of the EZT
# template file you wish to use for that view.

# Templates are specified relative to the installation directory, but
# absolute paths may also be used as well.
#
# If %lang% occurs in the pathname, then the selected language will be
# substituted.
#
# Note: the selected language is defined by the "languages" item in the

#       header.
