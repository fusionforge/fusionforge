about tuning LDAP

Hi,

we would like to share some hints regarding the improvement of OpenLDAP performance
on slow systems. Our GForge system is running on an Ultra Sparc 5 with 512 MB
RAM and 333 MHz.

Some of our users complained about slow cvs checkout and cvs handling with eclipse.
After some hours of debugging we have found a solution to this problem.

The main reason for the slow response is that if an application is trying to
resolve in which groups a user is, the complete directory tree is searched for
all uniqueMember and memberUID  matches. This is the default behavior of the
libnss-ldap package in Debian and it does take some time on slow systems.

Our solution was to recompile the libnss-ldap library without the 
configure option --enable-rfc2307bis.
In addition to that we installed nscd and created the following indeces:

index   objectClass             eq
index   cn,uid                  pres,eq
index   uidNumber,gidNumber     pres,eq
index   userPassword,memberUid  pres,eq
index   homeDirectory,gecos     pres,eq
index   loginShell              pres,eq

Hope this helps to improve performance - it certainly did on our system.

Kind regards
Lars Ehrhardt & Waldemar Brodkorb

I would add some more instruction
When you add the indexes in /etc/ldap/slapd.conf
I was told it's much better to stop ldap
/etc/init.d/slapd stop
Then you run 
slapindex
restart ldap
/etc/init.d/slapd start 

On a debian box you can see the improvement doing 
ls /var/lib/gforge/chroot/home/users
If you have a properly configured libnss-ldap of course

Some more improvement can be done installing nscd the Name Service Cache Daemon
apt-get install nscd on debian.
