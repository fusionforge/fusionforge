gforge-plugin-scmsvn
--------------------

This is the Subversion plugin for GForge. It creates Subversion
repositories and provides some functionality to manage them.

Prerequisites:

- install Perl, DBI and DBD::Pg as per GForge's INSTALL file

- You'll also need to install Subversion, as well as Python and the
Subversion-Python module (if you want to use ViewSVN). On Red Hat
systems, Python is available natively, but you may have to fetch
Subversion-Python packages from
<http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html>. It seems
Mandrake provides the module natively. Again, on Debian, apt's
dependencies system will take care of it all.

- ViewCVS (<http://sourceforge.net/projects/viewcvs>): warning only
latest CVS version supports SVN but Debian provides for example
ViewCVS packages that supports SVN.

Installation:

- files from etc/ go to /etc/gforge/plugins/scmsvn, apart from
etc/httpd.conf that you should install as /etc/gforge/httpd.d/10scmsvn
- files from bin/ go to /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/bin
- files from common/ go to /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/common
- files from db/ go to  /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/db
- files from cronjobs/ go to  /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/cronjobs

Setup:

- customise files in /etc/gforge/plugins/scmsvn to match your
preferences (SVN server, and whether to enable SVN by default for new
projects)
- create a gforge_scm user, member of all the projects for which you
want to use SVN
- setup the crontab from debian/cron.d
- gforge-config
- /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/bin/db-upgrade.pl
- /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/bin/install-svn.sh configure
- /usr/lib/gforge/bin/register-plugin scmsvn "Subversion"

Note about ViewCVS wrapper:

ViewCVS CSS static files (www/viewcvs/) and templates
(etc/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs/templates/) have been extracted from
ViewCVS Debian package version 0.9.2+cvs.1.0.dev.2004.07.28-1.4.

Modifications in templates:
- mainly include/header.ezt and footer.ezt
- TODO: conversion in XHTML
