gforge-plugin-scmsvn
--------------------

This is the Subversion plugin for GForge. It creates Subversion
repositories and provides some functionality to manage them.

Decompress the plugin tarball and place it into your plugins directory.
Usually, this would be in a location like /opt/gforge/gforge/plugins/scmsvn
Whereever you place it, be sure your /etc/gforge/local.inc file has
$sys_plugins_path pointing to the plugins directory.

The scmsvn/etc/plugins/scmsvn/config.php should be copied and edited
to

        /etc/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/config.php

The 'Site Admin' tab on the GForge web interface now has a 'Plugin Manager'
page where you can activate plugins on a sitewide basis. Be sure to do that
if you want this plugin to be available to projects.
