gforge-plugin-scmsvn
--------------------

This is the Subversion plugin for Gforge.  It creates Subversion
repositories and provides some functionality to manage them.

Prerequisites:

- install Perl, DBI and DBD::Pg as per Gforge's INSTALL file

- You'll also need to install Subversion, as well as Python and the
Subversion-Python module (for ViewSVN).  On Red Hat systems, Python is
available natively, but you may have to fetch Subversion-Python
packages from <http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html>.
It seems Mandrake provides the module natively.  Again, on Debian,
apt's dependencies system will take care of it all.

Installation:

- files from etc/ go to /etc/gforge/plugins/scmsvn, apart from
etc/httpd.conf that you should install as /etc/gforge/httpd.d/10scmsvn
- files from bin/ go to /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/bin
- files from include/ go to /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/include
- files from lib/ go to  /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/lib
- files from cronjobs/ go to  /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/cronjobs

Setup:

- customise files in /etc/gforge/plugins/scmsvn to match your
preferences (SVN server, and whether to enable SVN by default for new
projects)
- create a gforge_scm user, member of all the projects for which you
want to use SVN
- setup the crontab from debian/cron.d
- gforge-config
- /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/bin/db-upgrade.pl
- /usr/lib/gforge/plugins/scmsvn/bin/install-svn.sh configure
- /usr/lib/gforge/bin/register-plugin scmsvn "Subversion"
