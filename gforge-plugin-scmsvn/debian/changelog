gforge-plugin-scmsvn (4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Roland] Ported to Gforge 4.5.
  * [Roland] Fixed location of the svn-stats script in crontab.
  * [Roland] Also in svn-stats.php, added an offset for ARGV[] indices,
    since the crontab calls that script with additional parameters that
    should not be interpreted as date specifications.
