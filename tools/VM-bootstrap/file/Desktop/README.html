    <h1>FusionForge sandbox</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the FusionForge sandbox.  This VM/appliance is
    designed to help you get started on development.  It's basically a
    clean Debian system, with a checkout of the FusionForge code and a
    few helper scripts.  Those scripts are in the
    <tt>/root/scripts</tt> directory:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><tt>update.sh</tt> will update the sources from
      FusionForge's Subversion repository, and also the currently
      installed packages.</li>
      <li><tt>build.sh</tt> builds FusionForge packages from the
	sources, and stores them in the package repository at
      <tt>/root/debian-repository</tt>.</li>
      <li><tt>install.sh</tt> installs those FusionForge packages.
      This should end up with an up-to-date FusionForge running on <a
      href="http://forge.local/">http://forge.local/</a>.</li>
      <li><tt>start-selenium.sh</tt> gets and runs Selenium, which
      is needed for the testsuite.</li>
      <li><tt>run-testsuite.sh</tt> actually starts the
      testsuite.</li>
      <li><tt>install-gui.sh</tt> sets up an X11 graphical environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The actual source code is stored under
    <tt>/root/fusionforge-trunk</tt>, so that's where you should do
    the changes you want to test.</p>

    <h2>Running everything on the VM</h2>

    <p>If you run <tt>install-gui.sh</tt>, then you get a graphical
    desktop environment on the VM.  To build and install from sources,
    run the “Build + inst” script (there's an icon on the desktop).
    You can then use <a
    href="http://forge.local/">http://forge.local/</a>, with the
    administrator's login being “admin” and its password being
    “myadmin”.  To run the testsuite, launch Selenium and <em>keep it
    running</em> (possibly iconized) while you launch the “Run
    testsuite”.</p>

    <h2>Running remotely</h2>

    <p>If you don't want to install a full GUI on the VM, you can also
    run the interesting things remotely through SSH.  Depending on the
    configuration of your VM, the network settings may change, but the
    VM displays its IP address at boot time, so you can <tt>ssh
    root@192.168.x.x</tt> and work in there.  Note that Selenium needs
    an X11 display (since it drives a graphical web browser), so
    you'll need to run <tt>ssh -X root@192.168.x.x
    start-selenium.sh</tt> (note the <tt>-X</tt>).</p>
